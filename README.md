# FastClass
 Code of paper "FastClass: A Time-Efficient Approach to Weakly-Supervised Text Classification"

We provide `run_sst.sh` to reproduce the results of FastClass, and take the **SST** dataset as an example. 

```python
bash run_sst.sh
```
You can also use other datasets for testing, compare with other datasets, SST has a smaller amount of data and a shorter running time.

We used python=3.8, cudatoolkit=11.1. Other packages can be installed via pip install -r requirements.txt
