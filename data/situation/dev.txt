9	0Share The ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in announces that some people in Rwanda are suffering drought but denies that what it is being said about those who are fleeing to Uganda following famine is true because they might have gone to look for job as usual. This was announced by Minister Mukeshimana Geraldine in a press conference on this Monday 11 July 2016
9	She said It is for the first time in 60 to suffer such a drought in some parts of Africa including Rwanda. In July and August they were talking about El Nino and as we talk it is not only Africa because South Africa is importing food from abroad, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola and Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia it is even worse; until here in Rwanda. Days ago, izubarirashe.rw visited people from Musheri sector in Nyagatare district, eastern province where people were suffering famine so much that they needed immediate relief
9	In July and August they were talking about El Nino and as we talk it is not only Africa because South Africa is importing food from abroad, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola and Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia it is even worse; until here in Rwanda. Days ago, izubarirashe.rw visited people from Musheri sector in Nyagatare district, eastern province where people were suffering famine so much that they needed immediate relief. Some people we found their houses closed and headed to Uganda to earn a living because they mostly saw that they are not producing crops for eating
9	This famine ravages not only the Eastern Province but also the rest of the country and everyone who is in Rwanda notices it. RPF says the drought period that characterized Eastern Province, especially in Nyagatare, Kayonza, Kirehe and Rwinkwavu areas, is the cause of this famine. The same famine is in the lowland of Southern Province in Nyanza, Ruhango and Kamonyi, normally known as cassava producers but, have recently experienced cassava virus. Some people from these Districts are moving to neighboring countries, searching for a way of life, while others stay there because they have no means
8	That day over 40 were killed, while so many were injured in that assault against the refugees led by General Kagame Alex who used to be the head of Paul Kagame's presidential guards. 3. These killings happen after mass killings committed by this circle against other Congolese Tutsi refugees in MUDENDE and NKAMIRA camps in 1995 and 1996. 4. We cannot also forget extreme killings Paul Kagame and his circle committed against Rwandan Hutu who were in Kibeho camp in 1995, where over 80 innocent people were killed

2	African leaders reiterated the importance of development to curb the mass exodus of African migrants African leaders said that development is vital for putting to an end the horrible exodus of desperate African migrants. Far from the city of Johannesburg where the AU Summite is being held, more than 100,009 African migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea by small and congested boats to lead a new life in Europe. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 102,000 persons are estimated to have attempted to make the horrifying trip in this year. Most of the migrants were from Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, not all have succeeded. More than 1800 migrants have drowned at the Mediterranean Sea in this year alone. Leaders attending the summit in South Africa said that the problem originates from their countries. They agree that migrants are forced to flee their country due to conflicts, unemployment and unfriendly environment. South African President, Jakob Zuma, stated that leaders have a responsibility. "We have seen with pain and humiliation when our African brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and children lose their lives while trying to travel to Europe for a better life to escape from war, poverty, abuse and unemployment." said President Zuma. "We all share the blame and this crisis requires us to double our efforts for improving the life of our people." He added. Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said that Africa's hope lies in its commitment for growth. If we focus on training the people with technique and vocational courses as well as science, engineering, technology, mathematics and invention, they will stop their dangerous trip through the Sahara and Mediterranean Sea. Doing so will make it very hard for extremists and armed terrorist groups from conscripting youngsters. This important issue was supposed to be among the top agendas of the summit, though it was dominated by the news regarding Sudanese President, Omar Al-Bashir

8	when we cross the dictatorial defense- all of us will have better and equal social life. the time since we started to fight the PFDJ regime, what we the oppressed Eritreans spent cannot be counted as easy time, and we are not few quantity-wise. However, not only we couldn't defeat the regime that is identified by its thievery, we didn't step forward with our struggle as it should. Because of that the people are not free from the mercy of the repressive regime. Bluntly these fighting people, as people is living with one leg chained, its tongue blocked. for unverifiable reasons citizens one after the other are being picked from the streets, their workplaces their residences and are being imprisoned, disappearing and some are being shot. The cruel regime that is attentively carrying out such acts as its task, because of that, it's giving lectures and screaming about development and growth, and instead of saying in passing it is a vagabond regime that shouldn't have been there to begin with, there is no ground that encourages one to sympathize with or be confused by it
8	Once we cross this fortress of dictatorship, we'll have a better socio-political life for us all. It has been a long time since we, the underprivileged Eritreans, started to openly oppose the blind policies of the Eritrean regime. We are not small numbers, either. However, not only are we not yet able to triumph over the deceptive nature of the regime, but the progress of our struggle has not gone forward as far as it should have. Consequently, our people have not yet been fully freed from the bondage of this brutal regime. Unpretentiously, this courageous population, is living with the hands tied and the mouth shut. Citizens are being taken away, one by one, from the street, from work places and from residences, to be jailed, vanished, not to be heard from again and others are executed. If a regime that has deliberately perpetrated these barbaric actions on its people blusters and makes pronouncements about development and growth, there can't be any room for confusion or sympathy for a regime of bandits which should never have existed in the first place

10	Like the traditions of our elders and fathers as they say, a bad person crosses the border and gets lost so that people cannot identify him, this person, in the name of an Eritrean he was considered oppressed and offered asylum, and instead of being grateful for the asylum, in the name of charity to eradicate disease in Africa he swindled funds collected for charity and was arrested, since his lousy nature and habits cannot be hid wherever he goes, to avoid being asked to return the money he robbed on their name he is blubbering about things not done and not said to create a new country, even if he can be considered insane and ignored...what he mentioned and defamed our color and our society in his blubber has pained me like a big wound and I was forced to reply to him
10	As our elders and fathers say, a person who commits a bad deed, in order not be recognized, crosses the border and disappears. Likewise, this person, who was granted asylum as an Eritrean and as a victimized person, rather than saying `thank you', he was caught embezzling donations he collected in the name of fighting diseases in Africa. Because he cannot hide his shameful characteristics and habits wherever he goes, and to avoid accountability for the money he has stolen, he is talking nonsense and blabbering about creating a new country. One would have ignored his nonsense, but because I am deeply pained by how he has soiled the image of our society, I am compelled to respond

2	Current news - DW reported that German politicians and experts warned it is unwise for Germany to follow a policy of ignoring the gross human rights violations by the authoritarian regime of Issayas in return for containing migrants. (Israel,, Iran, Ethiopia as well) Germany - a delegate from the authoritarian regime of Issayas including the foreign affairs minister met with senior German officials. It was after this meeting that DW put a headline entitled "what shall come first from the protection of human rights and containment of the influx of migrants' and reports of German politicians and experts warned it is unwise for Germany to follow a policy of ignoring the gross human rights violations by the authoritarian regime of Issayas in return for containing migrants. "We have to take care that the talks between Germany and Eritrea don't just prevent the migration to Europe and change nothing about the human rights situation in Eritrea," warned the German Green Party parliamentarian "What is important, is that the Eritrean government allows an investigation into the human rights situation before the two governments speak to each other," added the lawmaker who is also the deputy chairperson of the German-East African group in the Bundestag. From the European side, there is the hope that if they invest money in the country, people will no longer be forced into this long military service and as a result, will not want to flee. That is simply naive," argued Nicole Hirt, an expert on Eritrea at the GIGA institute in Hamburg. She warned that Europe should rather put more pressure on Eritrea before putting money into it. According to the information from Deutsche Welle, Germany is one of the countries affected by the influx of Eritrean migrants and 25,000 Eritreans sought asylum in Germany in the past year alone. DW also mentioned the UN report accusing the autocratic regime of Issayas of committing crimes against humanity including abuses, rape and violence. The report also quoted the Chairperson of the UN Commission of Inquiry as saying "Eritrea is an authoritarian State. There is no independent judiciary, no national assembly and there are no other democratic institutions in Eritrea." -- -- -- -- -- -- Israeli newspapers reported that a court in Israel overruled the interior ministry's legal opinion that Eritreans who deserted from their country's army are never entitled to refugee status. The Israeli government follows a policy of denying refugee status to Eritrean migrants. This ruling of the court allows migrants to submit their individual requests. Only 4 migrants are granted refugees status out of the 43,000 Eritrean and Sudanese migrants who entered in Israel until March of this year. Iran/Yemen - The Iranian news agency (Farsi) reported that Saudi Arabia is training 5,000 militants in Eritrea to use them in the on-going war in Yemen. The terrorists were transferred from various terrorists groups in Libya. The terrorists, some of whom are from the Al-Qaeda, will be dispatched to Najran, Jizzan and Asir provinces to fight against the Yemeni army and popular forces and prevent their further advances in Southern Saudi Arabia. The authoritarian regime of Issayas gushed that it is the main force fighting terrorism in the horn of Africa and dismissed the information. However, the regime has been involved in the recruitment, training and supporting of militant groups such as Al-Shabab in Somalia with the support of Qatar. The regime has also been involved in the internal affairs of Yemen alongside Saudi Arabia, playing a destructive role with bigger consequences in the region. Ethiopia - BBC reported that 23 inmates died inside a prison in Ethiopia due to a fire accident while they were demonstrating against the government. The news cited reports of gunfire after the incident in the prison located inside Addis Ababa. The news also cites unconfirmed reports that the fire was deliberately started by the prisoners in a bid to escape from the prison
2	Germany's decision to ignore the open human rights abuses by the autocratic regime of Isaias as a tradeoff to block the influx of refugees has raised concern and criticism from politicians and experts, who have called the approach "naïve," reports Deutsche Welle. (and also Israel, Iran, Ethiopia) After official delegates including the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the autocratic regime of Isaias had met and held talks with the countries' officials, Deutsche Welle published an article titled "Defending Human Rights or Curbing Migration." Germany's decision to ignore the open human rights abuses by the autocratic regime of Isaias as a tradeoff to block the influx of refugees has received criticism from politicians and experts, who have called it "a naive approach." They have also expressed their misgivings, reported Deutsche Welle. "We have to take care that the talks between Germany and Eritrea don't just prevent emigration to Europe and change nothing about the human rights situation in Eritrea," warned the German Green Party MP. "What is important is that the Eritrean government allows an investigation into the human rights situation before the two governments speak to each other," adds the MP, who is also the deputy chairperson of the German-East African group, according to Deutsche Welle. "From the viewpoint of the European politicians, there is the hope that if they invest money in the country, people will no longer be forced into extended military service and as a result will not want to flee. That is simply naive," argued Nicole Hirt, an expert on Eritrea at the GIGA institute in Hamburg. She also warned, "I think that Europe should instead put more pressure on Eritrea before putting money into it." According to the information obtained from Deutsche Welle, since Germany is the preferred destination of refugees, therefore 25,000 Eritreans sought asylum in Germany just last year. The United Nations has confirmed that Isaias' autocratic regime has committed crimes against humanity in its detention camps and military facilities, including torture, enslavement, rape and murder, reports Deutsche Welle. "Eritrea is an authoritarian State. There is no independent judiciary, no national assembly and there are no other democratic institutions," said the chair of the UN's Commission of Inquiry. -- -- -- -- -- -- Israel: the Interior Ministry has rejected the asylum requests of Eritreans based solely on their status as army deserters in their home country; an appeals tribunal has overruled the Interior Ministry's legal opinion that they are never entitled to refugee status. The Israeli government has been enforcing a policy that automatically denies all asylum applications submitted by Eritrean refugees. The ruling from the tribunal requires the Interior Ministry to assess all applications for asylum individually. Up until March of this year, Israel has refused to consider more than 43 thousand asylum applications by Eritreans and Sudanese nationals. Of these, only 4 were approved. Iran/Yemen: according to the Farsi News Agency, Saudi Arabia has transferred nearly 5,000 militants from Libya. The militants, who belong to a number of terrorist groups, are now receiving military training in Eritrea to fight against Yemen. The terrorists, some of whom are from Al-Qaeda, will be dispatched to Najran, Jizzan and Asir provinces to fight against the Yemeni army and popular forces and undertake to prevent their further advances in southern Saudi Arabia. However, the autocratic regime of Isaias has attempted to dismiss the report by stating, "Eritrea has been in the forefront of the fight against terrorism," in a statement issued by the government. However, the regime in its bid to quench its perpetual desire for power and control, has demonstrably cared less for the stability of the Horn of Africa. In partnership with Qatar, the regime has been involved in supporting militant groups like Al-Shabab by providing them with recruitment and training services. The regime continues to play a highly destructive role in the region by joining the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to assist the Saudis' involvement in the internal affairs of Yemen. Ethiopia: at least 23 inmates have died after a fire broke out at an Ethiopian prison where anti-government protesters are reportedly being held, reports the BBC. Gunfire could be heard from the vicinity of the detention facility, which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, according to the report. Reports that the fire was started deliberately as part of an attempted jailbreak have not been independently verified

8	"The influx of middle east refugees is moving from Greece towards Italy" A German newspaper called "Frankfurter Zeitungen" reported that human traffickers who have been smuggling middle east migrants to Europe via Turkey and Greece are now smuggling the migrants to Italy through a perilous journey. According to the paper, the smuggling network stretches from the Turkish port town of Antalya to Mersin, a town near the Syrian border and from Athens, Greece to the Italian coast. The smugglers plan to use small boats for transporting migrants starting from April of this year. According to an anonymous smuggler, each migrant is expected to pay 3,000 - 5,000 Euros to get a space on the smuggling boat and the new smuggling route was opened due to the increasing number of migrants who wish to pass Greece and reach Italy. The smuggler said that two boats carrying at more than 250 migrants will reach Italy every week. This dangerous and long sea journey has now increased the 150-200 km distance to 1500 km. As it is known, this distance is almost twice the distance of the 800 km sea distance from Libya to Italy which is frequented by African migrants. Following an agreement between European Union and Turkey, Greece sends back migrants back to Turkey on their second day of arrival. So, the migrants want to reach Italy where there is no such arrangement and this new journey has concerned many that it may escalate the death toll as a result of sea accidents. Now that the influx of migrants from Libya and North Africa is added to the influx from Turkey, Italy is expected to take some tough measures as it has already been frustrated with the already large number of African migrants that it hosted
8	The flow of migrants from the Middle East will shift from Greece to Italy. German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung: The smugglers that used to transport Middle Eastern refugees to Europe via Turkey and Greece have planned to transport refugees to Italy over a new and more dangerous route. According to the newspaper's explanation, the smugglers in this smuggling network will use small boats to transport refugees from the Turkish port cities of Anatolia, from the city of Mersin near the border with Syria, and from Athens, Greece to Italian coasts starting in April of this year. According to the account of one smuggler, each refugee is forced to pay from three to five thousand Euros to have a place in the small boats and that the new route has been opened because of the number of refugees demanding to reach Italy from Greece. The smuggler added that he can transport at least two pairs of boats, each carrying 250 refugees, to Italy weekly. This new and very dangerous sea route has increased the distance to 1500km from the previous 150km to 200km sea route. As is known, what was once considered the busiest and most dangerous journey is the refugee route from Africa to Italy, which is only 800km, or half the distance when compared with this one. After the agreement between the European Union and Turkey, refugees are attempting to leave Greece, which is currently returning refugees to Turkey on the second day of their stay, to get into Italy, and it is feared that this will worsen the condition of the refugees and that they will die in previously unheard-of numbers. It is expected that this will affect Italy, which was struggling to receive refugees from Libya and North Africa even though their numbers were small compared to the flow of refugees from Turkey, and will make the situation worse and certainly lead it to take harsh measures against refugees
8	The Libyan Coast Guard has reported that they have discovered dozens of drowned bodies of African migrants which were said to be probably from Eritrea and Niger. Tripoli; 28 March 2016; The Libyan Coast Guard has reported that they have discovered dozens of drowned bodies of African emigrants from Eritrea and Niger. The head of the Coast Guard in Al-Garaboulli, Abdullatif Al-Munser, said that the corpses were discovered 75km to the east of Tripoli. Al-Garaboulli also said that the decomposed bodies washed ashore, and he suggested that the boat which the emigrants were on sank days ago, adding that it is very difficult to identify the dead emigrants as their bodies are totally decomposed. Local media have recently warned of the resumption of the small and illegal immigration boat trips to Europe from the Libyan coast with the start of spring, which is regarded as a good time for migration by sea. Therefore, it is expected that the number of deaths will increase

On Thursday, June 30, when the Italian Coast Guard arrived following a distress call, the 10 women were found dead of suffocation and crushed by more than 100 other passengers and drowned in the water that flooded the boat. The inflatable boat wasn't strong enough to withstand the heavy waves and strong wind. The rescuers said that the boat had accumulated so much water that the passengers were found with half of their bodies submerged in the water. In total, 107 people were rescued from the boat, and the Italian coast guards continued their search for more survivors. The number of casualties is expected to rise, as it is normal these days for such inflatable boats to be found carrying up to 140 people. This sorrowful incident happened at a time when the Italian authorities were preparing to collectively bury the bodies of more than 700 people who died in another fatal sea accident in 2015. The boat that was sunk in the Sicilia was recovered from a depth of 370m. As most passengers were locked inside their cabins during the accident, most of the bodies were found inside the recovered boat. In order to get income, smugglers are nowadays misleading refugees into believing that the weather conditions of the Mediterranean are good and stable. On that day, the Italian Coast Guard rescued 116 people in the waters between Sicilia and Libya

According to information released by a department in that international organization responsible for documenting missing refugees, the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea from January to March 14[th] this year is more than 525. IOM's data indicates that, as of March 14[th], 19,653 illegal migrants have crossed the Mediterranean into Europe, of which 80 percent arrived in Italy, while the rest have landed in Spain and Greece. Although the number of illegal migrants from various parts of North Africa and other regions who have arrived in Europe is smaller compared to figures from the same period last year, the death of more than 525 refugees this year in the span of 10 weeks is far greater than the number of deaths, amounting to 482, registered in the corresponding period in 2016.

Consequently, demonstrations broke out among Haramaya University students, as well as in the cities of Lekmte, Adama, Asela, Ambo, Ambo University, Ginbi and other towns, in opposition to this master plan that lacks public support and serves no interest of the people
8 4 10	Organizational statement issued by TPDM Under the guise of the language of development foundation, the EPRDF leaders have from time to time been issuing proclamations that are neither based on the people's welfare nor representative of the people, but encroach on citizens and prolong their own stay in power. The citizens kept demonstrating to protect their interests and rights, while the EPRDF types are bent on quashing them in a manner worse than that of previous regimes. It has been a quarter of a century. Consequently, in addition to heavy financial and material losses inflicted on the people and the country, many innocent citizens lost their lives in the streets. In the past few weeks, the ruling regime, without prior consultations with the people, issued a proclamation on a master plan for cities and tried to implement it, with no understanding or sensibility, in the suburbs of Addis Ababa Finfine and some cities in Oromia Region. Consequently, demonstrations broke out among Haramaya University students, as well as in the cities of Lekmte, Adama, Asela, Ambo, Ambo University, Ginbi and other towns, in opposition to this master plan that lacks public support and serves no interest of the people. To crash the uprising that started to stop this move directed against the people's interests, the regime's security forces took aggressive measures, shooting and killing university students and other civilians, and injuring and jailing countless others. The Tigray People's Democratic Movement strongly condemns these actions. Esteemed people of Ethiopia. As the situation has not been resolved, the large protests unfolding against the EPRDF group, are getting out of the regime's control and have spread beyond the nationals of Oromia Region into other Regions and cities. Although the ruling regime's policies, which are not centered on the views and sentiments of the population, are widely practiced on the Tigray people, the people of Tigray have been stifled and bridled by a special harness to prevent them from expressing in unison their grievances and from protesting and organizing. Otherwise, the people of Tigray do not have interests and benefits different from those of other brotherly peoples of Ethiopia. Thus, it is necessary to understand that the EPRDF regime does not represent the Tigray people. It should be clear to all that the people's feelings, which cannot be stifled for long, will soon erupt and bring about a lasting solution. And if the risk of devastation hanging over the people and the country, which is created by the oppression, is to be stopped, the ruling EPRDF regime, which is the source of all the problems and lacks any responsibility towards the people, must be removed from power. Our esteemed people: You should strengthen the unity of your ranks and continue the struggle you are waging against the EPRDF based on your conviction in this truth. The Tigray People's Democratic Movement (TPDM) affirms that it shall stand by you in all forms of struggle you pursue and provide all assistance required from it. Reminding that the Tahasas First bomb attack on innocent Muslims as they performed their Friday prayers at Anwar Mosque in Addis Ababa, and the resulting serious and moderate injuries, was the outcome of the ruling anti-people EPRDF regime, the Tigray people's Democratic Movement strongly condemns this act and calls for such tragedy not to be repeated against innocent citizens.

10	Help, who will investigate a criminal? I am a son of a peasant. I need help from the police who have a conscience and journalists. I have not any knowledge about law. At 2:50 on 12/31/2012, my store was broken into by thieves. My relative caught a thief. Then, during this period, this thief stabbed my elder brother at five spots of his body. When he was chasing the thief, he bled so much that the blood affected his lung. Because of this, the doctor said he needed a serious surgery, which would cost us twenty thousand yuan, respectively, for the necessary blood and surgery. Up to now, the police have not taken responsible for this. I don't want to seek help for chasing the escaped thief. This incident happened on the 31st day of that month. It is past 1 month and 2 days after that incident, however, and since now, no one has come here to collect the fingerprint of that thief. Abdushkvr: 13899990642 If this thief committed other crimes, he should have been caught sooner than this. What kind of store you have? If you capture that thief and take him to the police station, the police would take charge of it, depending on their wills. You should remember that there was limited time for looking after these issues except from the Three Evils, including separation, extreme terrorist, and separatism. Let us make this topic reach a climax. > Let us make this topic reach a climax. This thief would be a partner of the dominant ethnic group and the police. It is best to be dependent on yourself. My neighbor captured and beat the thief who stole his sheep. Then, the police station's policeman set my neighbor off with a 700 yuan fine and many threats. My neighbor regretted it too much. Did you forget to report to the police? I mean maybe you would report to deaf police at that moment. Ah, why was my good answered deleted on Misranim? The thing you have to do is to cure your brother. Chasing the thief is a right of the police. You can borrow money to cure that disease, rather than stay there by saying no money. You can appeal for complementary civil compensation when you have a chance. You could report to the higher police department if the local police don't care about this case. This case is a robbery from a burglary. Furthermore, you said he is your relative. If he had money, he would not steal. Why not cure him by collecting the support from your relatives. Carefully keep those bills for the medical expenditures. This comment, which was submitted at 00:05, 01/03/2013, is classic: This thief would be a partner of the dominant ethnic group and the police. It is best to be dependent on yourself. My neighbor captured and beat the thief who stole his sheep. Then, the police station's policeman set my neighbor off with a 700 yuan fine and many threats. My neighbor regretted it too much. The leadership's ethnic group don't have mustaches, do they? A relative said: As our friend said, at first you should use your own money, or borrow money to cure your brother. This is very important. You should report more loudly to that deaf police. If it doesn't work, you can complain about them to the government of the county, city, or prefecture, if you are correspondingly living in a township, county, or city. Maybe there would be a policeman who has been cured of being blind and deaf. You can cure the local deaf police by complaining to the program of Law and Citizen. ‏ First, it is important to cure the disease. The remaining things would be handled later. May Allah bless you. Now, in this unique world, people are astonished by the news that they never heard about, for example, even the police have become burglars and pickpockets. The police have been quickly handling the issues of ethnic separatists and terrorists who have mustaches and cover their faces with scarves. The leadership's ethnic group don't have mustaches, do they? A relative said anonymously............ At first, you should fully understand its content, shouldn't you? Why do you comment so abruptly as a cudgel coming out of a bag. What kind of saying is a relative thief? Can you write more clearly? Do you mean Hans are thieves? Can you write more clearly? No matter what kind of thief, they should be punished based on law. Have you seen the scene on the Internet of beating thieves by the self-organized people in inland China? The world, which should be written Tuqan, was probably written Tughkan. In fact, the victim could be an uploader's cousin. For Kumul, this kind of case is considered to be a big one. If this happened in Kumul, the thief should be imprisoned now................................... Do the Urumqi police have the spare time, or are they having the New Year holiday? If not, you can go to the city department of police to report them. You should have insisted that the thief came your store to practice terrorist activity rather than to steal anything. If you did so, maybe they would investigate it. First, you need to report to the police again. If they ignore it, you should call the program of Law and Citizen. They must ask if this is open to the public. Now, in some offices, the number of the people who forget their responsibilities is growing, unless they get some a bunch of alfafa or get a beating at their flanks. How do you admire that Law and Citizen? That is a means of propaganda. According to the executed case, that film was produced after the Political and Law Committee and another place permitted it, by the cast, composed of a judge and plaintiff. If I saw the people who came to the higher court to bluff he would go to the Central Committee, I will.............. The article that was uploaded at 14:08, 01/03/2013, is believable. For Kumul, this kind of case is considered to be a big one. If this happened in Kumul, the thief should be imprisoned now................................... Do the Urumqi police have the spare time, or are they having the New Year holiday? If not, you can go to the city department of police to report them. This person seems to be not in Urumqi. Maybe from Hotan. If the phone number was left here, I would argue for him on phone. Yesterday, I gave a good lesson to a guy who committed domestic violence in Korla. If he beats his wife again from now, I will call 110. I will detain him 15 days according to criminal law. If you starve your wife and children by removing the cards for electricity, water, heat, and natural gas, I will call your office to fire you. Don't think no one can be responsible for the women. As of today, I will promise my all words. After I told him if necessary, I would give testimony in court, that hypocrite was afraid that I missed at night and came to my house at 5 in the morning to give the electricity and natural gas cards & I got them. I am now kidding. The man with 115 kilogram weight, like a pig, beat his helpless wife. I really should have called 110 to imprison him. They should be the police in the south. They don't care for the cases about public security. If they have political cases, they will rush to handle it even they have no shoes. If you report to the police, the policeman won't come because he will insist on that he should be on duty at police station. Why did you not say that you encountered two terrorists and separatists who attempted to destroy our country's unity when you called the police? You ask for help from the police and journalists with a conscience.... I think you will be disappointed with them. You ask for help from the professions that don't have a conscience, don't you?....... The best solution is to find your own way. Maybe you can find the information in your society. The person who entered your store must know the condition of your store. The person who stabbed your brother must have minor injuries. Ablikim's thread, uploaded at 23:28, 01/02/2013, was correct. If you capture that thief and take him to the police station, the police would take charge of it, based on their wills. You should remember that there was limited time for looking after these issues except from the Three Evils, including separation, extreme terrorist, and separatism. You said a honeyed word was like a sugar crystal. Emsa0999's thread on 21nd floor was correct at 17:08, 01/03/2013: How do you admire that Law and Citizen? That is a means of propaganda. According to the executed case, that film was produced after the Political and Law Committee and another place permitted it, by the cast, composed of a judge and plaintiff. If I saw the people who came to the higher court to bluff he would go to the Central Committee, I will.............. These words would walk if they had feet and hands. This criminal should be investigated by the local police. Except for them, who can investigate him? You should call repeatedly under the situation of not destroying the criminal site. If the local police are deaf, you could report them to the higher police department. Some people joked that if you reported a terrorist attacked your store, the police would come. Please don't do this. If you did so, a division of military would come, and you would be imprisoned rather than that thief. Over the years, these policemen have been a lake of responsibilities. When I meet the police, I want to spit on them. Fortunately, they have not met me. Last year, my cousin was arrested from an electronic casino in somewhere like Tikichi or Wutunchi in Korla city by the Awat Farm Police. Then, he was released because he was local resident. HMPH. Until now, that electronic casino has been opening without a closed day. It is a shame that these shits are ruling us. A few days ago, three carloads of people from the city came to our neighborhood, and beat one boy with their sticks. After we reported it to the Awat Police, the policemen arrogantly blamed him on why not hide from them, rather than investigate the case. After 2 months, until now, they have not given us who committed it. Why not, they can't handle this kind of little thing even though we have a cell phone with camera. These people, who are in charge of implementing the law in this big country, are so useless. At that moment, we provided the police what we saw. How unfair it is. I am confused why these irresponsible journalists don't report this news in order to bear the people's burdens. First, the most important thing is to cure your elder brother. Be patient. The police will catch that criminal, and handle him based on the laws. You can find Ekber and Shohret from Xinjiang Radio Station,,,

Yes, the earth shook, our land shook. The nation trembled and hearts trembled. The hearts of our brothers living in the land have been crushed and a sorrow has come to their life.

10 4 9	He was born to a wealthy peasant family in 1925. In 1949, 20 Cambodian youngsters were offered scholarships from the French Protectorate of Cambodia to study in Paris, France. (At that time, Cambodia was under French suzerainty.) Among them, there was one peasant's son. This youth's name was Saloth Sar, and his later name was Pol Pot. (However, at that time, even his family didn't know Pol Pot was his name. Since 1975, this name, Pol Pot, has become a shocking name in Cambodia.) After Saloth Sar came to Paris, he got in touch with Cambodian students and joined the Cambodian Student Union. During this time, after he studied Marxism and Leninism, he formed his understandings of socialism and communism. In 1950, Saloth Sar founded the Cambodian Communist Party. In 1956, he returned to his country and worked for the French underground anti-colonist movement. Following that, he gained more and more power. In 1976, by overturning the pro-American regime with his armed forces, he became prime minister. Then, the skirmishes that were occurring between the Vietnamese and Cambodians intensified into a war between them. As a result, Vietnam occupied most parts of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge sentenced him to lifelong imprisonment in 1997. He died due to illness. In 1970, Lon Nol seized the regime from Sihanouk under the American military's support. In 1975, Pol Pot declared unexpectedly his order of starting a revolution. On April 17, 1975, he became prime minister by overthrowing Lon Nol's regime. On June 21, 1975, Mao Zedong met Pol Pot. On January 1, 1976, he announced new a constitution and laws and changed the country's name to Democratic Cambodia
10	Stalin-Borbut in southeast Asia. talin-Borbut in southeast Asia. He was born into a rich peasant family. In 1949, 20 Cambodian youth won scholarships to study in Paris (Cambodia was a colony of France at that time). Among them was a peasant's son named Saloth Sar, also called Burbutie (though his family didn't know it, he was called Burbu as well. From the year of 1975 on, the name Burbu would be very famous in Cambodia). After he came to Paris, Sharlut Zhao made contact with students who had come to Paris previously, and invited them to join the <Cambodia students' union>. During this time, he studied Marxism and Leninism, and formed his views on social democracy. In 1950, Sharlut Zhao established the <Cambodia communist party>. In 1956, he went back to his country and engaged in underground activities against the French colonial regime. Later on, he gradually enhanced his activities, and in 1976, he overthrew the pro-American government. After that, Vietnam would occupy most of the country in the course of the war between Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1997, Burbu was sentenced to life imprisonment and died of an illness in 1998. Earlier, the Langno group had overthrown Sihanouk with the help of America. In 1975, Burbu had ordered the whole country to start a revolution, which overthrew the Langno group. On June 21st, 1975, Mao Zedong met with Burbu. On May 1st, 1976, Burbu proclaimed a constitution and established democratic Cambodia. Thus, the king, Sihanouk, had been deposed, after which the Khymer Rouge had implemented communism and declared a ban on possessing capitalist or personal goods, thereby eliminating features of normal life. He directed his government to control everything and destroy opposition. This policy caused 1 million and 700 thousand people to die by hunger, war, disease, and crime. The dead included 200 thousand Chinese. (Some materials said 3 million Chinese died). After that, name of Burbu instilledfear among the people. On Feb. 25th, 1978, Vietnam declared war on Cambodia, the 10th regiment with 200 thousand troops divided into 7 groups to attack Cambodia. Vietnam's aggression subjected it to strong opposition by global society and Cambodian society. In May, 1981, a Cambodian democratic regime was established by King Sihanouk. In September, 1989, Vietnam withdrew. While international society suggested that he build a peaceful country, Burbu refused and declared that he would stick to communism. Therefore, the Khymer Rouge isolated itself and lost the assistance of international society. The gradual deterioration of the social system and living standards made people doubtful about the administration of the Khymer Rouge. So Borbu relaxed his policy and permitted officers to do business and have their own goods. In 1993, there was a general election in which Khymer Rouge candidates were not elected (for reasons known to all of us). In August, 1996, the vice-premier of the Khymer Rouge surrendered to the central government, along with his more than 3,000 troops. In June, 1997, after hearing that the commander in chief had surrendered to the central government, Burbu arranged for someone to kill a family of 8 people, including the commander in chief, Songqing, and his wife and children on July 25th, 1997. The death of the commander in chief angered the army, but by then Burbu had gone away. Later on, Burbu was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. After the death of Burbu, more and more people begin to surrender to the central government. By December 12th, 1998, the last 8 commanders had surrendered to the central government, along with more than 1,000 troops. The Khymer Rouge had suffered serious damage. A soldier's mood is not stable. The death of the commander in chief enraged the troops and led to the arrest of Burbu. On April 15th, 1998, he died of heart disease and his corpse was burned by 4 troops. Therefore, he still cannot build a monument to himself and his dictatorship. We want to see if you have a picture of him. He was punished by truth. One death is not enough. Oh world. The world would come back at you. I've heard the saying that we should thank Vietnam. We should thank them. Cambodians queued to welcome the Vietnamese. The next year, our country had declared war on Vietnam. They lost face in global society in the next war. Burbu had led communism into a blind alley and broken the image of communism. He would have turned Cambodia into a primitive society if he had stayed for a long time in the government

By 9 o'clock, February 13, six counties, Yutian, Minfeng, Cele, Luopu, Moyu, Hotan, and 7,838 people had encountered a disaster. As of now, 982 people have been evacuated to safety (so there were many people who needed help). 157 houses collapsed and 180 houses were damaged severely and 3,117 houses were lightly affected and some livestock were killed. It has been 3 days since the earthquake
9	A Fake Compassion Covered by Charity A Fake Compassion Covered by Charity Tashpolat Bilal Elqut A strong 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit Keriya , Hotan Prefecture, on February 12. By 19:00, February 13, Urumchi Time, 7838 people were affected by the earthquake in six counties of Hotan including Keriya, Niye, Lop, Qaraqash, and Hotan County. Currently, 982 people among the affected people were properly situated ( most of the people in the affected area are still in danger). 157 houses collapsed and 180 rooms were severely damaged. The number of the rooms slightly damaged is 3117, and some barns were also damaged. It has been 3 days since the earthquake struck the area. From this morning, I have been browsing websites for related news about the earthquake, but I have not seen any news, only messages about charitable activities for the brothers in the affected area. My heart has been broken. Eight thousand brothers and sisters in the poor area , eight thousand, hit by a merciless disaster and hardship. They remained homeless and helpless in the cold winter. The hands and feet of innocent kids froze and hardened. The mothers crushed under lifelong poverty and deprivation attempted to warm up their children with the last warmth that remained in their exhausted bodies and could not stop their tears. Bowlegged old grey beard fathers were stretching out their hands and making supplication to God for help. .. But their ten million brothers are busy with something else; they are still excited about the expensive show and Turkish pop stars. They are busy with planning to buy tickets for an upcoming show with a new Turkish star. If ten million brothers donated 1yuan( CNY), that would be ten million yuan. f the money is distributed to eight thousand people, it will be 1250 CNY for each person. That is not enough for them to survive through the winter and to manage their life properly after the disaster? Ten million yuan. It is not very much money. How difficult it is to collect this much money from our businessmen and rich people in our homeland? How difficult it is to build a new city in the affected area if ten million people work together ? What a pity! Where is action? Where is love? Where is brotherhood? Where is the faith of Islam and where are the people preaching on websites? Is this is not a chance to get rewards and to be faithful by doing good things? Is there any faithfulness more than this? What I am seeing ? Silence, ignorance, heartlessness, and irresponsibility . Suddenly I remembered some earthquakes a couple of years ago in the inland Chinese provinces. All were active and all were rushing to the affected area. Despite the far distance, our charitable people prepared goodlooking Uyghur breads and urged everyone to bring Uyghur foods to their Chinese brothers in the affected area for warming their hearts. The destination was very remote but the charitable aid arrived quickly. But our eight thousand affected brothers in the earthquake disaster in our homeland have been suffering from the cold and hunger for 3 days. The distance was very close but our love has not been able to warm up their hearts yet. The Uyghur breads have not been delivered to them by Uyghurs and we have not been able to cook and bring Uyghur food to them. In short, we could not fulfill our responsibilities as their brothers and as Muslims. Where are the charitable people ? Polo and kabab ( Uyghur foods) cannot be cooked in Hotan? Where are our businessmen and riches? You generosity cannot reach Keriya because it is too "far" ? What you have seen is your own motherland and those are your own people, not strangers. What you are seeing is needy and delicate hearts that expect love and hope from their brothers and there are no smiling faces there. Where are our Uyghurs? Where are our faithful Muslims and where are our businessmen and riches? If your love and compassion to your brothers have hardened like an ice or stone please chop them into smaller pieces and share with us
9	Fake love hidden inside charity. Fake love hidden inside charity, by Bilal Elqut. On February 2, there was a magnitude 7.3 magnitude earthquake in Yutian county, Hotan Prefecture. By 9 o'clock, February 13, six counties, Yutian, Minfeng, Cele, Luopu, Moyu, Hotan, and 7,838 people had encountered a disaster. As of now, 982 people have been evacuated to safety (so there were many people who needed help). 157 houses collapsed and 180 houses were damaged severely and 3,117 houses were lightly affected and some livestock were killed. It has been 3 days since the earthquake. I began reading Internet news regarding this event but no Uyghur news agency is reporting about helping or getting help for our brothers. My heart was broken. 8 thousand Uyghur brothers, and 8 thousand brothers in poor areas have now become homeless in the cold winter and are under tremendous stress that cannot be described in words. Tender hands and feet and lovely faces of children have become pale in the cold weather. Mothers who were poor and needy for life were holding their children in their arms to warm them with their own barely warm bodies and they were crying hopelessly. Strong fathers were praying and touching their beards with their wrinkled hands. Their 10 million brothers were still excited, talking about a Korean stars' music event, held some days ago, and thinking about the one that would be held in some days. If one person gives one yuan, one million brothers can make one million yuan. If this money were distributed to 8,000 people, it would be 1,250 yuan for one person. Isn't it enough for them to survive the cold winter and diminish the worry about disaster? 10 million yuan. How much do you think this is ? Do you think it is hard for famous entrepreneurs and rich people to collect 10 million? Do you think it is hard for 10 million people to get together to build a new city out of a stricken area? Unfortunate! Where is the action? Where is the love? Where is the brotherhood? Where is Muslimhood? Where are those Muslims who are so devout on the Internet? Isn't this a good opportunity to do good deeds and implement piousness? Can someone be more pious than this? What am I seeing? Impatience carelessness, hard-heartedness, irresponsibility. Suddenly, those earthquakes that happened over these few years echoed in my head. People near and far were all in action. Philanthropists made delicious nang. Although it was a very long distance away, they quickly appeared before their brothers and warmed their hearts with warm polo. Our philanthropists donated money, every-day supplies, and other material generously. The destination was so far away, but the help came on time. It has been three days since there was an earthquake and 8,000 brothers are in a disastrously cold winter. We are so close but we did not help them. Our nang hadn't reached them and we are not able to cook them polo. In short, we did not perform our obligations as brothers and Muslims. Where are those philanthropists? Can your roasts and polo be cooked in Yutian? Where are our entrepreneurs and rich people? Could your generosity reach those remote areas such as Hotan and Yutian? This is not just anyone's homeland. This is a treasure place where I was born. And these are not "other" people. These are the people who encourage us. This is not the face that smiles a lot. They need our brotherhood and encouragement in this cold weather. Where are those Uyghur, pious Muslims, entrepreneurs, philanthropists? Chop your cold-weather brotherhood with your weak ax and send it to those brothers who need help

7 5	The visibility was reduced to less than 10 m at 9 o'clock at night. The city of Hotan witnessed the phenomenon of the wind and sandstorm. The severe wind and sandstorm attacked the city, which was enveloped by plastic bags and all kinds of rubbish everywhere. The whole Hotan city was shrouded in haze at 8:45 at night. People in the street started to look for a place to protect from the wind
5	2 On the 20[th] day of that month, we headed toward Bostan village in Chire County. Aas far as we knew, some residents' houses were in a really dangerous situation. Although the Earthquake resistant houses building policy had been well implemented, some peasants still couldn't afford the bills they were required to pay, so they missed this benefit of that policy. After our careful investigation, we narrowed our target down to 12 families. Among them, we chose 3 families to pay 7 thousand, for a total of 21 thousand, and signed the guarantee letter and contract with the village officials by entering these three families into the township yearly plan. These houses will be finished after 7 months. I am incapable of describing the happiness of those 3 families. After we finished, we gave 7700 Yuan cash and supplies worth 5000 Yuan to other families in difficulties. We returned the county at 8 p.m. A suggestion on One Yuan Plan: If possible, we should consider the houses of the other 9 families. By paying each of them 7000 Yuan, we can make them live in new houses. We believe we can solve this problem
9	1 Yuan Plan in Kiriye May peace be upon my relatives, it's been a few days since the earthquake hit Kiriye. With this earthquake, all of our hearts also were shaken. We can feel this through Wechat and on websites. On Feb13, I sent a Wechat message to ask people to help the earthquake victims, and after four short days, the total donation of the One Yuan Plan from netizens and friends for the friends in Börtala reached 70000, and nearly 4000 used clothes in 96 sacks, and 200 suits of new cloths were collected. In order to deliver these supplies to the victims in rural areas, where aid has not been delivered, 3 charity workers headed to Hoten on Feb 1, and started to visit them. Other charity worker reached Urumqi to send 26 sacks of cloths to Hoten, and returned a day later. The following are the diaries of the charity workers who were in Hoten;1.We arrived at Atchan village in Kiriye County on Feb 19. We left for Künes village and Shunggul village after we got the information that the supplies had not been delivered because of the dangerous road conditions there. Our goal is to help the people who need those supplies. Indeed, the road toward these two villages was so dangerous that it took nearly 4 hours to travel 60 kilometers of road. Luckily, the guys who welcomed us in Hoten prepared a SUV for this trip. You can't hold your tears when you see elderly people, so like your own grandparents, burst into grateful tears while they accept donation of money and supplies. We delivered 10,000 Yuan cash, and supplies worth 5000 Yuan, and 150 new clothes. (We were informed of the lack of supplies according to people who had been in the scene of earthquake, so we bought supplies from city.) We returned to the county at 10 o'clock that night. 2 On the 20[th] day of that month, we headed toward Bostan village in Chire County. Aas far as we knew, some residents' houses were in a really dangerous situation. Although the Earthquake resistant houses building policy had been well implemented, some peasants still couldn't afford the bills they were required to pay, so they missed this benefit of that policy. After our careful investigation, we narrowed our target down to 12 families. Among them, we chose 3 families to pay 7 thousand, for a total of 21 thousand, and signed the guarantee letter and contract with the village officials by entering these three families into the township yearly plan. These houses will be finished after 7 months. I am incapable of describing the happiness of those 3 families. After we finished, we gave 7700 Yuan cash and supplies worth 5000 Yuan to other families in difficulties. We returned the county at 8 p.m. A suggestion on One Yuan Plan: If possible, we should consider the houses of the other 9 families. By paying each of them 7000 Yuan, we can make them live in new houses. We believe we can solve this problem. Other friends, don't feel disappointed ever. We will reach all of you to solve your problems after we fund the remaining money. We believe that more people have more power, and a true man should be anxious about his people. 3 On the 21st day of that month, after we received 26 sacks of cloths from Börtala at the freight station, we directly distributed 12 sacks of clothes to the people in Karasu village, and carried other clothes to the Oytoghaq village. The village leadership suggested that, after they gathered the people in this region, we could distribute to them the supplies based on their real condition. In addition, they also suggested we could afford some college students after having conversation with them. We appreciated their suggestions. In that touching scene, we saw the poor faces we had never seen before, the hands full of calluses, and the eyes full of love... We directly poured 14 sacks of clothes and other supplies from Börtala and started to distribute them to the crowd. We gave 40 college students 200 Yuan each, totaling 8000 Yuan. We put 5000 Yuan into the pockets of sick elderly people. What we brought was not enough, so we had to say goodbye in a sad mood to these kind people. The college students and people, as well as the people in Bortala from the other side of mountain, sent their gratitude and regards to the One Yuan Plan community,. 4 On our way back from Hoten, we planned to visit the rare village in Guma and Qaghilik, but for some reasons we couldn't stick to our plan. We went back to Urumqi on the 27[th] day of that month. We donated 8000 Yuan to two patients in the Second Hospital, and then left for Börtala. 5. On May 1, after other 70 sacks of cloths were send to Urumqi, and then were delivered to Kiriye on May 5. These cloths are still distributing. Wapadarim 912 words: To warm hearted charities who sent money and cloths from Börtala: May peace be upon you. We tried our best to deliver the money and supplies you sent to us for the most needed places. All these photos were shot from the senses, and certification of donations will make up a photo collection. After May 12, you can check these photos from "Irpan Book Store" or "Sherbet Cold Drinks and Ice-cream Shop". We are more than grateful to the friends, who have helped us to go through and organize 96 sacks of cloths, to the drivers named Perhat and Turgun, who povided twice free services for tranporting those 96 sacks of cloths and carry a young man who is responsible for them. (it would cost more than 1000 Yuan). May Allah give them a good fortune and healthy body. Amen... To One Yuan Plan Netizens: This time the total amount of donation fund for the disaster is 16700 Yuan. Now, I want to tell the lovely people who donated that the details of this account, real-time photos and notes can be checked my moment on wechat, or if you want, you can add my wechat account and I will send you those to you. We have all the evidence of receiving money, I am more then grateful... To the generous sons of Hoten: Since the day our guys reached Hoten, you all took care of them by accompanying them. Thank you for sharing a SUV to take them to the rare villages in order to reach the goal of this activity. You've been suffered doing all these, and we show our highest salutes. After those 3 housed have finished, we may go to disturb you again, or if we can't make it we may also disturb you to help us. Take care my friends... Last words: We have finished this activity. 3 charity workers spend 10 days on this journey by paying with themselves. They have suffered and see a lot. The most important thing is their passion for charity work had been increased. If you get the chance to hear their feeling, it would be like a thanksgiving lesson. This is not the end for the One Yuan Plan works in Bostan village. We have paid 3 families 21,000 Yuan to found earthquake resistance buildings. Until now in Börtala we has funded 35,000 Yuan for 5 families among 9 families in Kiriye. Soon, we will sign the contract for building the earthquake resistance houses for these 5 families in the cost of paying each 7000 Yuan. For remaining 4 families, we will try our best to fund 28,000 Yuan to make sure that all 12 families on the list will move into new houses. Dear God, by this chance may this village have the name of "One Yuan Village" in people's heart. In the names of donors from Börtala, we will continue our great tradition, " When a disaster struck, the helps will come from all sides" , to help these 12 families against the poverty. May each of us with our duties help them to be free from the name of poor... In the end I want to show my respect to all the supportive and lovely friends.

9	The One Som (RMB) Project in Keriye Greetings, brothers and sisters, it has been quite a while since the earthquake in Keriye. As the earth shook, so did everyone's heart, and that has been demonstrated through news media such as WeChat and the Internet as a whole. >On the evening of February 13th, I reached out to the netizens of the One Som Project about extending their helping hands to the people affected by the earthquake. It took as little as 4 days for The One Som Project netizens and brothers in Bortala to raise a donation worth 70,000 Som, 96 bags of clothing items equivalent to 4000 articles of clothing as well as 200 pieces of new clothing. In order to bring this whole commitment to the people in the most remote and neglected areas possible, 3 of the donors set out on a journey to Hotan on the 17th and started paying visits on the 19th. Another donor took with him 26 bags of clothing items to Urumqi to send out to Hotan, and returned the next day. The following is a diary of the donors who visited Keriye: 1. We arrived in Atchan Village of Keriye Prefecture. After learning that help did not reach the Kunes and Shung'gul villages because of bad road conditions, we decided to go there instead, as we were hoping to cover the places that needed the most help. The road did indeed turn out to be in terrible and dangerous condition. We barely finished the journey of 60 kilometers in 4 long hours. As a positive sign ,though, the young folks who had traveled quite a journey to greet us had a cross-country vehicle prepared. One would not be able to hold back tears seeing those grandpa-and-grandma-like old folks thanking you with tears in their eyes. After delivering the 10'000 Som in cash, 5000 Som worth of goods (based on the information provided by those who had travelled to those places and learned about the unavailability of material goods, which we had brought with us) and 150 pieces of new clothing items, we returned to the town center by 10:00 pm. 2. We took off for Bostan village in Chira Prefecture at 6:30 am on the 20th. As we soon found out, some of the houses were in terribly dangerous condition. Although the quake-resistant house construction policy was well-implemented here, some villagers did not benefit because of a lack of funds that they were supposed to produce by themselves. Through detailed research, we determined 12 families among which 3 were picked for a plan that would help them pay 7000 Som each to have their houses built as part of the village's annual plan. A letter of guarantee and an agreement were signed with the village administration stating that the houses would be submitted for use by July. I am too weak to describe the happiness those people displayed at the time. After that, we distributed 7700 Som in cash and 5000 Som worth of goods among families in poverty. We returned to the town center by 8:00 p.m. Here's a suggestion to the One Som Project donors: If possible, could we please do something about the housing conditions of the other 9 families?; say, help them each pay 7000 Som to move into new houses? We can certainly do this. All other brothers, please don't grieve. We will soon produce some more money so that we can take care of you. Where there is unity, there is strength. People's concern is with people. 3 On the morning of the 21st, we went to a shipping center and picked up 26 bags of clothing items sent from Bortala and delivered 12 bags to the people in Qarasu village in Bostan County. We took the rest of the bags to Ottiaq village. The village administration staff proposed that they gather the people who need the most help and that we then distribute the items based on their needs. The administration also suggested that they bring together the kids who were going to college so that we could help them, too. We were very happy about the arrangements. The scene was extremely heart-breaking. Faces we had never seen reflected poverty and hardened hands, with eyes expressing love...We poured out 14 bags of clothing items donated by the people of Bortala and started distributing them one by one. A total amount of 8000 Som was given to 40 students, 200 to each. 5000 Som was shared among the old folks, both men and women, who were present. As help was so limited, it was difficult to leave them. All the students and folks sent their warmest greetings and appreciation to their "relatives" in Bortala, the town on the other side of the mountains. 4 . After returning from Hotan, we meant to pay a visit to the poverty-stricken folks in both Guma and Kaghilik counties. But, for certain reasons, our plan did not work out, so we returned to Urumqi on the 27th and managed to bring 8000 Som to 2 patients who were being treated in the 2nd People's Hospital. Then we went back to Bortala. The remaining 70 bags of clothing items that had been sent to Urumqi on the 1st arrived in Hotan on the 5th. These clothes are now being distributed Thoughts and feelings from Wapadarim 912: To the donors who sent money and clothing items: Greetings, donors! We did our utmost best to deliver the money and items to their designated destinations. Photos taken on the scene and proofs of distributed money and items will be filed. They will be available for public viewing in both the "Irpan Bookstore" and the "Sherbet Cold Drinks and Ice-cream Store." To the friends who helped with the sorting of each and every item of clothing, to the friends who shipped 96 bags of clothing items to Urumqi for free (the equivalent of 1000 Som, if charged), to the driver brothers, Perhat and Turghun, who gave free rides to the young fellow who was responsible for the shipments: may God make their life journeys smooth and wish them health, Amen! As for the netizens of the One Som Project: The total amount that has been sent to the One Som Project account is 16,700 Som. The rest were cash accounts. What I can say to the beloved ones who sent all this money at this point is that I have all the daily accumulated records in my WeChat. You can view those if you wish or I can send them to you if you would like to add me. The monetary proofs of all the scenes are available. We truly thank you... To the generous men of Hotan: You took the time to stay with them and to take good care of them from the day our boys arrived in Hotan. You prepared a cross-country vehicle for the journeys to the most rural villages and helped us reach destinations and contributed tremendous efforts. Our highest salutes to you. When we go to look over those 3 houses as part of the first phase of the approval process, we will trouble you again or we might still trouble you even if we can't go. Be well, friends! Conclusion: Our task has come to an end. 3 of the doners spent 10 days at their own expense, going through tremendous hardships, seeing a lot and learning a lot. Most importantly, their passion for charity has grown. Listening to their experiences of the scenes is like taking a currently-promoted appreciation lesson. The One Som Project's activities in Bostan village have never ceased. We donated 21,000 Som to 3 families. Up until today in Bortala, we raised 35,000 Som for 5 of the 9 families left in Keriye. Soon we will be preparing 7000 Som and signing guarantee letters for each of the 5 families for their quake-proof houses. We will also take care of 28,000 Som for the other 4 families. We will do our utmost best for those 12 poverty-stricken families who will also be moving into new houses. Please, God, who knows, as it happens, whether this village might get popular or gain attention as "The One Som" Village on people's tongues. In the name of the donors of Bortala, we will do our very best to help the 12 families; and especially the 3 families trying to get rid of the "poverty hat" with our continuous efforts, and also develop the spirit of "One person in difficulty, everybody else helps"... Lastly, we send our salute to all those beloved who offered support. It was written in my darling's room in Bortala City on March 8.

5	Words failed me when I illustrated how I felt was so excited that I had to control my tears of gratitude. The earthquake did happen. The epicenter where a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck was a depopulated zone, about more than a hundred kilometers far away from Yutian County and more than ten from Aqiang Village. In addition, it was the day time when the earthquake happened in a depopulated zone, when people were busy with their work outside of their houses. Therefore, the earthquake didn't cause much damage regardless of the 50-60 collapsed houses and the loss of several domestic animals, when it was compared with the number 7.3. Kona Shahar, the Yutian County mentioned on the Internet was a special region which took shape initially as a well-preserved cultural locality for Uyghur people like the Kashgar. Damaged houses existed here because of its dense population and many linked old houses. People naturally wondered that what kind of houses they were. The cracked houses which worried people by their records are probably about 50-60 years old. The newest was even eight years or five years ago

10	The men: To a children trafficker < Our Elder Brother> Don't steal my dear child. Muhemmettursun Abduréhim Oghlani Should I say you are an elder brother? Maybe you are younger than me. But if my child is safe, I will want to call you elder brother at once. We suffered many difficulties to raise that small life. We remembered our child with our every breath, and we were full of grief when our child got sick. If we were tired and entered into the house, or were exhausted from a trip or life, our child would give us comfort. This made us forget those difficulties and dangers. A child's various habits will give the parents fresh lives. If he disappeared, our hearts would be broken with our unstoppable tears. Brother, you silently took them that were very loving lives. It is a death for me by stealing my world. Have you been hearing my weeping? Those children mean money to you, but your money will run out. If you act like human beings, you will make a fortune also. Look those people who making honestly earned money, they lived long. Fortune will come to the industrious. Please think it again and again. Your father raised you just like that, your mother raised you just like that. If you have a kid, from the bottom of your heart, you will raise him just like us. I will never mind to call you elder brother, but please have a conscience for these trafficked children. The child is the heart of his parent. Let them be raised by their parent.

10	Oglani: For human traffickers Don't grab my child, please. Muhammat Tursun Abdurehim Oglani. I will call you elder brother although you are of younger age than I. I am willing that you be my elder brother if you return my son safely. The little youngster gives us more and more misfortune. We call to our child every minute and every second. We went inside when we were tired. We felt happy when our children had comfortable lives. A child's every movement gives its parents new life. Tears always are shed if he isn't there. You took the child away quietly. You grabbed my child and left me alone in my sorrow. Maybe you grabbed my child for money, but money will vanish as you spend it. As you are a human, you should do what a real human would do. When people make real money, you can see that one lives a longer life. Please think again, can diligent people make more money? Your parents looked after you as I look after my child. You always look after your child if you have a child.

Of course, this is due to the fact that the earthquake occurred in a sparsely populated rural region. A rockslide damaged 150,000Mu of grassland, which caused 319 livestock to be killed. The pictures you saw on Wechat in recent days are from the most seriously damaged place. In total, there are only 10 pictures. We know that the reports from news agencies from the Central government and the Autonomous Region are from those pictures. However, some people on the Internet have posted pictures from the previous year's earthquake, giving wrong information. What you have seen here is the real condition of Uyghur people in this rural area. They are too poor to assemble donations. People who came here to assist these victims also updated with live reports. Now I want to say, please collect donations based on their need. We really need the necessary supplies. The victims are living in emergency tents, and because the affected region is in the mountains, they need coal for warming. Because so much land has been damaged, they need fodder for their herds too. Please remember to visit the poor Uyghur people in rural areas regardless of any excuse. I wish someone could collect money to cover the volunteers' travelling expenses. In this way, we could spend money on other poor Uyghur people in other rural areas, because this is a sparsely populated region, whose area is very large. Even if you reach here, you would not know where to find them. We are touched by people's motivations, reflecting a united spirit that says that, if one side is in trouble, the other sides will come to help. So, I advise those hesitating to come, think carefully. Accordingly, the current supplies and donations from our enterprisers and the government have exceeded expectations. ...... May Allah keep you all healthy ...... Ababakri Muhtar, reported from Misranim: an affected region, not a disaster region. May peace be up on you, my friends. I'm representing Misranim, Anatuprak, Qimbulak and Karwan websites to give a live report regarding to the condition of the affected regions. As I said at the beginning, words like "disaster region" in articles undoubtedly shocked everyone. A disaster region is an unfortunate place we don't want to visit. The correct term should be "an affected region." Please pay attention to your word usage. This morning, after a conversation with the leader of Keriye County, I found out that, since yesterday evening, many friends have delivered fodder and coal for the victims. Even the supplies from the government have exceeded the people's needs. I suggest other friends not come here, as other media have reported, because this situation is not as bad as it sounds. But still, with Allah's mercy, I am sad, having seen our friends' poverty. The people, who are already poor, attract our attention after this earthquake. God know how many poor families like them are existing in Xinjiang. After all, distributing the donated supplies has become a problem. Many charities are raising donations now, but the families live far away from each other. Under the circumstances, it is almost impossible to deliver the supplies to them. How we should do this? To hand over all the donations to the county government is the only way. The county government is full with donations coming in. But if you are familiar with the personality of the Uyghur, especially the Hoten's Uyghur, you can guess that it's difficult for them to go personally and pick up the donations from the government--out of their pride, and their unwillingness to beg for help. As we seen from the TV, usually the affected area is full of victims who are eating and living together in many shelter tents; but here, even though we're in the most affected area, you can't see more then 10 tents. If fresh polo was made by one of our people, it would be leftover because of the trouble in gathering enough people to eat it. It's commonly agreed that if supply exceeds need, people become lazy. But the victims need our help. What they need most right now is financial aid. The affected area, with its poor villages, need a financial guarantee to continue their normal production and daily life. We suggest people who can donate help the poor villages. We would be truly happy if helping hands reached the places that need them most. One more thing:, due to the already heavy supply, if further donations are sent, people should fill out the form shown in the picture. It's hard to deliver the personal donation to the government. We just heard the local school driver, Rawan in Hotan, is on his way to do the formal paperwork to donate 30 tons of coal. A lot of donations have been collected in the Urumqi. If it's not too much trouble for you, we suggest distributing donations house by house. You may face some trouble if you provide personal donations without a responsible person or company name. It's not difficult to feel the blessing of Allah toward our hometown, giving us the opportunity to deliver our love and care. Although, if the situation was as bad as they say over the net, there would be no time for paperwork, and we would not stand still without helping the victims. As a reporter from a private organization, I have been reporting the things I have seen without extra details. May happiness always be upon the kind people. Those who weren't able to be in the affected area personally, please donate your money to the people in need. As long as your goal is not to come here and take pictures, your donation can help the people needing medical treatment and education , and not necessarily the healthy people living in the affected area. The unrevealing part can be figured out by our people. May Allah bless all of us
9 6	We visited some of the residents in the Old Town of Keriye County, where the houses had cracks in the walls. Companies such as Abide and Miras sent humanitarian aid, including food and clothing to the affected people at the scene; in the meantime, they also passed along warm greetings to all our brothers and sisters. On websites, local people were interviewed on the spot. If Allah allows, we will publish the details on our websites as soon as possible. At present, our brothers' moods and mental states are strong. The second station is Achchan Township. Other news on Keriye from Uyghur web visitors: Hello! Dear brothers, today we left from Urumqi in the morning and arrived in Hotan at 9:00 in the evening. We took rescue goods with us that were provided by companies such as Abide and Miras. ,In the meantime, reporters from Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Karwan, Chimbulaq and other Uyghur websites took their microphones with them and went to the affected area. It is a 50-km distance from here. We handed over food and clothes to the affected people together with the companies' representatives. The power level of the earthquake is a 7.3-magnitude, an extremely high number. However, Allah protects our homeland: it was as if a miracle happened. According to the information from the Atchan township government, no casualties were reported, but the walls of houses were cracked. The cause was the epicenter being sparsely populated. In addition, 150,000 mu of pasture was destroyed by the huge mountain slide. 319 farm animals died. Everyone saw pictures of the earthquake on WeChat. Well, those pictures that you saw were taken from the most affected area. In total, there are no more than 10 pictures and all pictures were taken from CCTV and Xinjiang TV: there are no new pictures. However, some web writers published old pictures that were taken of the earthquake that occurred several years ago aspart of an attempt to convince the public that the pictures were taken of this quake. This resulted in a bad feeling among the people. One could only feel the real situation of our people on the actual spot. It was our peoples' poverty in Hotan that led to the considerable donation activities among us. People did not stop making donations until now. Visitors who came to the affected area also spread the news and tried to respond to peoples' feeling. At the moment, I would like to suggest that if someone were to make a donation, or organize a support team, the most needed and necessary things are coal and animal fodder. Because the affected area is close to the mountain, night temperatures can reach levels so low that local people need coal in order to stay warm. In addition, a great number of winter pastures were destroyed; therefore, the livestock and house animals need fodder. If people want to help, their best choice is to send only their representatives. It is difficult to contact the affected people or local officials here, because the affected area is so wide and the population settled so sparsely. If you come here, I want to inform you that it is really difficult to contact the affected people or local officials. In that case, you would not be able to hand over your donations. We are very impressed by our brothers' help and kind responses. Through these deeds, they show their generosity when others need urgent help. But we further suggest that you consider more calmly before you decide to come here. At present, there is already enough food and other daily necessities, even more than they need..... May Allah be grateful to you!..... Ababekri Muhtar's report from the Misranim website: The term "disaster area" is the wrong expression, I think. The correct phrase should be "affected area." Dear brothers, I am a representative of websites such as Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Chimbulaq and Karwan, which reported the situation at the affected area. The term "disaster area," used in a lot of reports and essays, really surprised us. The literary meaning of the term "disaster area" is "dangerous place where people can not stay". Therefore, the correct expression of this term should be "the affected area." I hope we use the correct term and words when writing essays. This morning, I talked with the head of Keriye County and found out that our brothers donated a great amount of coal and animal fodder. Currently, the rescue goods and other necessities at the County storage facilities have already exceeded the needs. Furthermore, I do not recommend that many people come here, as has been mentioned in other media because the situation is not as serious as we had imagined from afar. May Allah be merciful to our brothers! It is a pity to see our people's poverty and these miserable conditions. This time, the earthquake let the public know just how poor the local people were. How many poor villages existed in Xinjiang like that? Only Allah knows! Well, then, we return to our topic: it is a difficult problem to hand over rescue goods and other donations to the affected people. Charity organizations and the people did a lot of good things, but emergency goods must reach the hands of the affected people. Due to the fact that local residents settled down sparsely, how should we get the donations into their hands? What can we do? Certainly, the only way is to deal with the county authorities. Greetings and items arriving recently have reached those places as well. Something else that is unfortunate is that Uyghurs -- Hotanese in this case, as shown from their characters -- do not feel comfortable making a plea for help. It seems that the items we brought will not be picked up so easily from local authorities by villagers. As we have seen on TV, when earthquakes happen elsewhere, thousands of people gather together to have their meals in the open and live in tents. Unfortunately, it is hard to find even as few as ten tents in the most quake-affected areas here. If someone cooks a big pot of Polo, it will get left over when the cook fails to find anyone to eat it. We all know that if supply surpasses demand, people will become lazy. But we should pay more visits to the brothers here. What they need now is financial help. In other words, those who have been affected as well as those living in the most rural villages who have not been affected by the disaster need a financial guarantee to get back to their normal lives. We ask our brothers to extend their material items to those who are in poverty. We will certainly be grateful if the gracious hands of brothers reach all those in need. Something else that I have to remind you of is that since supply surpassed anticipation in some disaster-affected areas, those who would like to help the disaster-affected areas must fill out the forms. It is difficult for the government to accept and receive donations from donors. We just received the news that the Rawan Driver Education School had set out to hand over 30 tons of coal with relevant legal documentation. Many places in Urumqi raised donations. It would be best if you didn't mind covering longer distances and just distributed the financial help house by house. You will face a series of difficulties in receiving and distributing if you don't distribute the material items in the name of an organization or an entity. This shows that Allah kept our hometowns safe and gave us the opportunity to extend our warmth to our brothers and sisters. But if the situation is as serious as the way it has been publicized online, there will not be enough time to register and get the necessary paperwork done. And thus we would have set out to meet the needs of our people. Since I am a privately employed reporter, I have been reporting certain things as they are without any embellishment. Eternal happiness to the generous hearts. To those who could not make it here, please don't be annoyed. Keep extending your gracious hands to the needy. It would be best in coming here if you didn't take pictures. It would be best if the waves of donation were not only for those who are physically healthy in the disaster-affected areas, but were also for those who are struggling in beds of sickness and for those poor who are not able to receive an education. Brothers whose minds are awake should be able to understand what has not been said. May Allah keep all of you safe
9 6 5	The round-up report on Kiriye. The round-up report on Kiriye. Because of poor network service, I could not renew news on my blog. Please forgive me. We have reached Keriye county, and are going on our trip to the affected region. Recently, people on Wechat complained and argued about both a Turkish singer and the people who spread news about this singer, which made Wechat a battling site. Since yesterday, the comments on Mis Ra Nim web had started to blame Xinjiang TV Station for spreading that news. Everyone has turned their attention to the earthquake, and we have left for there. We criticized our entrepreneurs, but they also left for the affected region this morning. So those complaints have vanished. Following that, we started to blame those who had not reached the site. According to the information given by the youth, some young people and companies will reach the site tomorrow morning. And then, some people are still blaming them. But in fact, those companies are helping the victims. Now we've started to blame the people who are on their way to the disaster site. We sincerely hope that our friends' diseases are cured as soon as possible. If God allows, we will arrive at the affected region to report the situation in the next two days. We appeal to our friends to spread the solidarity and kindness, not rumors, on our Uyghur's Wechat moment. Thanks

The people of Qaradöwe, Lapchuq, and Tohochi witnessed a scene that they had never seen in their lives. The older folks said these towns have never suffered this kind of disastrous flood. In Tohochi, Kariz, their only source of water, a source with hundreds of years of history, was buried by the dirt. Hundreds of houses were toppled. Hundreds of livestock were washed away. The vineyards were inundated. The farmlands were destroyed. The sky alternated its color between darkness and red, and it had been raining continuously, calling to mind the old saying that the rain is a relief, unless itis a disaster. Qaradöwe was also destroyed in the same way. The raging water was flowing in the ravine, which had never encountered this enormous water. What on earth did the old men and women whisper about? In this moment, deciding between life and death, the people should unite and cooperorate to resist this cruel disaster by standing shoulder to shoulder. Native folks were tremendously upset. The folks calling and encouraging voices from around the corners drowned out the storm's turbulent and arrogant sound. Every local government's department, staff, worker and leader have already started to resist this disaster. On May 21, 2015, the flood, which was out of control, started to abateslowly through the afternoon. The passionate and warm-hearted volunteers and philanthropists, who came from other places to help in Qaradöwe, Lapchuq, and Tohuchi, have already arrived in these wounded ancient towns. The lively humanitarian lyrics started from the corners of the streets, healing every piece of broken heart. Ah, how great my people are! No matter what kind of cruel catastrophe happens, nothing is ahead of you. The song of unity from your people, crashing the mountains into dust, is being sung Go into battle. Let us go to a safe place. The victims from Tohochi. Unity is a power. The affected livestock. 35 workers from Kumul Sharizat Company are helping in the affected areas under the leadership of their directors. The philanthropists have come. Al Abide is in action. I hear that today the legitimate registered charitable organizations will help these affected regions. The related departments are working as best they can to assist in post-disaster relief. The leaderships of both Qumul District and Qumul City are with the people in the affected region to guide the works of post-disaster reconstruction. The people will never forget the leader who was devoted enough to serve the people. People from all over wish bravery and strength to the people in the affected region. We stand with you all the time.

I believe the Party Committee of Qumul District and government should work for their people better than other places in the Autonomous Region, which is known for the people who have been in Qumul before. I was very sad after I saw this. May Allah bless them. No one can resist this disaster by himself, and no one can just prevent the damage. Once, the houses, called Earthquake Defending Houses, couldn't resist any more. Then, the houses were named Earthquake Resistance Houses. Ah, how great my people are! No matter what kind of cruel disaster happens, nothing is ahead of you. Because the song of unity from your people, crashing the mountains into dust, is being sung. May Allah relieve their difficulties. I bless these united and diligent people. I pray they find the best way to handle these difficulties by following Allah's words. I wish that the people from unaffected regions should assist them as much as they can, and intelligent people should pray for atonement constantly by pondering on the power of benevolent and mighty Allah. For sure, our impregnable bulwark is our prayers, and our peace is the fruit of our atonements. May Allah pardon us and relieve the affected people's difficulties. I believe that the people in Qumul will overcome these difficulties. As long as there is unity, everything will be fine. May Allah bless you. May Allah prevent disasters like this
0 5	Erkim: Kumul flood disaster. Kumul flood disaster: there was heavy rainfall in Kumul on May 20, 2015, which caused the heavy flood disaster in the morning of the next day. There are five ancient cities in Kumul, in which three were attacked by the flood disaster. People from Wupu, Sipu, and Sanpu townships witnessed a scene that they never had seen before in their lives. The old people said that this kind of catastrophic flooding never happened here before. Sanpu Township had hundreds of years of history. The only source of drinking water in the area, Karez, was buried in earth. Hundreds of houses collapsed. Hundreds of livestock died, and hundreds of counties were damaged. A lot of grapevines were eradicated by the flood. The farmland was flooded. The weather was changeable. The clouds were sometimes changed into black and sometimes were dark red. The rain continued to fall strongly. The disaster situation both in Sipu and Wupu townships was very serious. The concave ground that had held no water for a few centuries was full of flood water now. The old men constantly muttered when seeing these things. In this moment of life and death, we must unite together against the merciless disaster. The villagers moved to take part in the disaster relief. The yelling and the cheering sound arising from around the area overpowered the violent thunder of the flood. The government agencies, companies, employees and leaders acted quickly. The out-of-control flood began to slow down on May 21, 2015. The volunteer blood donors who would donate blood for Wupu, Sipu, and Sanpu townships had been in the disaster areas. The songs of love sang in the streets. The heart burnt by the disaster was consoled by the love. How great the people are! Any catastrophe cannot conquer you. All the people sang the song of unity to crush the hinderance. We are fighting! All the villagers should go to the safe place quickly. Unity is the strength. 35 employees from Hamesher and Rizatti companies are giving aid to the disaster areas under the leadership of the leaders. The legal charitable organization also goes to the disaster areas today. Related units are trying best to prepare the post-disaster relief work. The regional government as well as the municipal government in Kumul also went to the disaster areas to guide disaster relief work. The leaders who do good deeds for the masses will be remembered by the masses forever. Toughness and persistence will be with the people in the disaster areas. We will stay together all the time.

According to news reports, experts at the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention found genetic components of the Zika virus in two babies who died due to microcephaly. This would be the strongest evidence yet to prove the connection between Zika virus and microcephaly. America and Brazil will undertake related clinical and scientific investigations on infectious diseases as a next step. Thus this machine asked pregnant women not to travel to regions that are affected by the Zika virus, and warned that pregnant woman who were staying in the Zika virus region for an extended period of time needed to avoid being stung by mosquitos

The abrupt arrival of the snowstorms, the agonizing train collision, the trials of the Olympic torch relay, up to the current 5.12 Wenchuan earthquake. This is yet another scar etched deeply on the chest of the Republic
7 1 5	Recently, student Liu Linhai of our Class 0208105 unfortunately lost his life in the Great 5/12 Earthquake, and our call to students of the School of Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate program '02 to extend a helping hand to his parents was positively responded to by everyone. This also includes both HIB students and alumni at home and alumni abroad, to whom we would like to express our heart-felt gratitude. In addition, school faculties are already making applications to resolve the loans that he owed to pursue his study. However, as our nation is in a disaster, we should still focus our attention on the overall situation and make our contributions to the nation and the disaster-hit area. So thank you everyone for your good intention. We hope you could donate your money to the affected areas and to more needy people. If students of the School of Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate program '02 want to make a donation, you may contact us directly. In addition, please note we have not posted any bank account numbers online. True feelings are revealed at times of disasters. Once again, our entire 0208105 class would like to express our heart-felt gratitude to everyone's attention and blessings on behalf of the late Liu Linhai and his family
3 10 7 5 1 0 9	Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation, and alleviate public anger. According to information leaked from numerous channels, we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck, the serious earthquake risk in the Ngawa region was already well known to the CCP. Although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time, place, and strength of an earthquake, there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month, and the area of a province
7 1 5	On the other hand, Mike (Mike Boyer), editor of "Foreign Policy," indicated in an essay in a special column, "China quake will test Beijing's transparency, crisis management" (China quake will test Beijing's transparency, crisis management), that up until now, the Chinese government seems to be fairly liberal with the release of information regarding the massive earthquake in Sichuan, and the government's approach is still rather satisfactory
1 5 10	It was said that Wen Jiabo immediately went to inspect the disaster area, but he couldn't at all enter Wenchuan, the epicenter of the earthquake, where large torrential rains after the quake were falling. It was learned that due to seriousness of the breaks and =collapses in roads, as well as continuous aftershocks, the advance force of the Chengdu Military Region has up to now had no way to rush to the urban area of Wenchuan county, the epicenter of the earthquake
5 10 0	The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand, such that even if it is highly capable, it won't last long, as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things. This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake. A time without volunteers or mental workers, such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches, as well as enterprises and public institutions. As soon as the earthquake occurred, grass-root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments, in an interdependent manner
3 10 5 0 9	Such a behavior will only hurt the good image that Chinese have presented to the world in the earthquake rescue and relief efforts this time. Following the great earthquake in Sichuan, China, Chinese people both at home and abroad have become united as never before, demonstrating unprecedented love and philanthropy. Countless touching stories able to move people to tears have been told during the disaster relief
7 1 5 9	However, owing to Premier Wen breaking away from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee collective and the State Council, flying over to Sichuan to put on a one-man show, and then issuing commands to Beijing from Sichuan and deploying troops, the leaders of the relevant departments had no choice but to fly over to Sichuan to confer over disaster relief work, before heading back to Beijing to make phone calls and delegate work; typically ineffective behavior and a waste of manpower
3 10 7 5 1 0 6 9	The Tangshan Earthquake left behind over 4000 orphans. In the Wenchuan Earthquake, the first things to collapse in practically every town were the school buildings, while the government buildings next door were far sturdier. The bodies of the students killed in the earthquake came to rest in the school playgrounds, the unremitting wretched cries of many family members confirming the deceased or paying respects harrowing the hearts of the hearers
3 10 5 0 9 6	Following the great earthquake, all over Tangshan squares, school playgrounds and pedestrian walks on both sides of streets lay piles of dead bodies and wounded refugees. In disaster-hit areas, streams of people who carried wounded people for medical care and medications can be seen everywhere

On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake, i.e. July 28th, those on duty at Mao Zedong's quarters were Wang Dongxing, Wang Hongwen, and Mao Zedong's confidential secretary, Zhang Yufeng. In the early hours of the morning, with the clock hands pointing to 3:42, the ground of Zhongnanhai suddenly started to shudder
0 1 5 10	Terminating the torch relay, I believe, will be able to win compassion, understanding and support of the international community, as well as understanding, endorsement and support of the whole nation. Terminating the torch relay will only present an image to the international community that the Chinese people face up to realities, seek truth and pragmatism, fear no difficulties, share one purpose, and unite to fight against the disaster. On the contrary, if we simply continue the relay, the international community will only turn a cold shoulder to and look down upon China
3 10 7 5 9	Now with the earthquake in Wenchuan, people all over the country are burning with anxiety over the disaster rescue efforts. But a small number of flunkies of the foreigners went wild and intentionally made hateful insinuations towards and mocked the image of the PLA to stir up tensions between the military and the government and between the military and the people. How can this be tolerated?
1	Now with the earthquake in Wenchuan, people all over the country are burning with anxiety over the disaster rescue efforts. But a small number of flunkies of the foreigners went wild and intentionally made hateful insinuations towards and mocked the image of the PLA to stir up tensions between the military and the government and between the military and the people. How can this be tolerated?! Some flunkies of the foreigners say: "When Israel created helicopter airdrop operations, did they have a landmark? When in a war, will the enemy let you wait for a beautiful and cloudless day to airdrop your troops?" "Helicopters, why haven't you taken off yet? As of now, over forty hours have passed, and according to CCTV reports, only a few helicopter sorties were made, and some have returned because of the rain. ffdds thinks that Premier Wen's remark was absolutely right: "I don't care what you do, I just want these 100,000 people out of harm's way. That's an order!" Isn't it just raining? An American helicopter could save Chinese students who fell down the mountain in a car crash in the mountainous area, and they could save a Japanese fishing boat in a thunderstorm. Why can't our helicopters reach the epicenter? What do these flunkies of the foreigners mean by saying these words? Does it mean the PLA's flying skill is not as good as Israel's, or that the PLA didn't do their best to carry out disaster rescue? Do these flunkies of the foreigners know the maximum limits for which helicopters can fly and land? Do these flunkies of the foreigners know the maximum limits for which paratroopers can be airdropped? Don't these flunkies of the foreigners know that whenever the country has difficulties, they can always see the PLA =unit sacrificing their lives every time
7 3 10 5	Normally it's possible, but in this particular earthquake it isn't possible. Because Wenchuan County is in a valley, you must descend in order to be able to conduct a rescue. In addition, for Wenchuan, this sort of place lying on the edge of the plateau, ordinary helicopters cannot necessarily fly up there. A helicopter used specifically for plateaus may be required
7 5	China's central government recently gave the order for wealthier provinces and cities to immediately provide financial and technical assistance to those areas hit by the earthquake disaster. This order enables cities such as Beijing and Shanghai to collaborate with the less developed regions of Sichuan Province. It signifies that China has realized the difficulties inherent in the task of rebuilding each settlement from scratch, and finding accommodation for around five million people
7 1 5	The speed and the scope of influence of transmission over the Internet are enormous. After the rumor "Ma Yun only contributed one yuan to the earthquake relief" appeared on the web, I really worried that too many people had believed this rumor. Supposing that was the case, it would not only harm the reputation of Ma Yun and Alibaba, it would moreover tarnish and sully the sincere compassion towards the people of the disaster zone of those enterprises and entrepreneurs steeped in a sense of social responsibility . The leader of the American civil-rights movement, Martin Luther King, once gave this sort of analogy about rumors: "Rumors are like snowballs; the longer they roll, the larger they become." In the case of these "rumor snowballs" like that about Ma Yun's donations, if we don't put a stop to them, they will certainly roll ever larger. Although it is said that "the wise will not listen to rumors," not everyone has the ability to discriminate. What can really end rumors is not some "wise person," but "openness." Let us take a look here at the real action of Ma Yun and his Alibaba company when confronted by the earthquake disaster

Tencent has demonstrated =great strength in this event, as not only has the company donated RMB 10 million, but Tencent users have donated over 10 million in disaster-relief funds
7 1	These frequently occurring foreshocks may disturb those animals that are sensitive to vibration. In particular, it should be noted that the earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale that occurred in Haicheng, Liaoning, on February 4, 1975, is the only successful prediction in the world to date that is undisputed, scientifically meaningful, and of benefit to the public. This successful forecast was precisely based on monitoring of frequently occurring foreshocks, rather than on reports of unusual behavior among animals, which were later widely spread

Eventually, they will also take up responsibilities of creating new achievements in scientific, economic, political, and cultural areas
0	In 1975, Chinese earthquake scientists luckily predicted the Haicheng earthquake accurately. Those in power at that time used this as teaching materials to show that socialism is superior to capitalism. Unusual animal behaviors such as "making noises in minor earthquakes and arriving in major earthquakes" were also used as absolute truths in earthquake prediction, and were later widely disseminated. After reform and opening up, China has been geared to international standards for thirty years; but after all, seismology is not a popular subject. Although most scholars have accepted that earthquakes are not predictable, on the public level, there are still a lot of people who believe that there must be some forewarnings for earthquakes. Therefore, after the occurrence of the Wenchuan earthquake this time, incidents such as migration of toads were heated discussions online. If anyone said that an earthquake was not predictable, there would be an uproar and they would be castigated immediately. A good nation must learn from disasters before it says how difficult it is to be prosperous. If we did not have sufficient financial resources to build buildings with anti-seismic standards after the great Tangshan earthquake, with unprecedented national strength today, we have every reason to learn from advanced countries and shift the focus of response to earthquakes to measures of disaster reduction

The Ministry of Water will put its efforts to implement five major tasks in earthquake relief efforts. The first thing is to ensure flood safety for destroyed reservoirs, hydropower stations, barrier lakes, dikes, silt dams, and culverts, and the most important of the current earthquake relief work is to prevent occurrence of secondary disasters. The second is to increase working teams to investigate the damage of the water supply in rural areas and some cities rapidly, organize efforts to pay close attention to repair damaged water supply facilities, and help the earthquake-stricken areas to restore water supply as soon as possible. The third is to strengthen hydrological forecasting and to do a good job in flood control scheduling. The fourth is to organize and develop emergency repair of damaged water conservancy projects and post-disaster reconstruction planning. The fifth is to ensure that communications with the disaster areas are kept open

After four or five minutes of swaying, a side of the building already collapsed, and the building where he stayed was also shaky. Dong Bo struggled to stand up. Dong Bo came to his wife's ward and saw about six or seven panicky women. As the only man there, he started to calm down. He remembered the self-help methods he learned while he served in the military, and started to direct people there to tear the sheets from the bed into strips and connected them into ropes.
