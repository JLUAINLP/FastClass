9	This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.
9	He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.
9	In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.
9	One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.
9	They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.
9	Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.
9	They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.
9	Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--
9	"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?"
9	But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.
9	He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--
9	"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!
9	A little wee man, in a red red coat!
9	A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat; If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."
2	Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.
2	He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.
9	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.
9	But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--
9	"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"
9	But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--
8	"Old Mr. B!
8	Riddle-me-ree!
8	Hitty Pitty within the wall, Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!"
1	Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.
9	Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--
9	"A house full, a hole full!
9	And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"
9	The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.
9	But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.
9	On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.
9	They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.
9	Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all.
9	He ran in front, singing--
8	"The man in the wilderness said to me, `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'
8	I answered him as I thought good-- `As many red herrings as grow in the wood."'
9	But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.
9	On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.
9	Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.
9	But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--
8	"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!
8	Flour of England, fruit of Spain, Met together in a shower of rain; Put in a bag tied round with a string, If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"
9	Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.
9	The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.
9	On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.
9	They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.
9	But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--
8	"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz!
8	Hum-a-bum buzz!
8	As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!
8	They were the very bonniest swine That e'er went over the Tipple-tine."
2	Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
9	But he ate up the honey!
9	The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.
9	But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.
9	On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.
8	But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--
8	"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck, With a white counterpane round his neck, Forty doctors and forty wrights, Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"
9	Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again.
9	But still he did not speak.
9	Nutkin became more and more impertinent--
8	"Old Mr. B!
8	Old Mr. B!
8	Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door; All the King's horses, and all the King's men, Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore, Off the King's kitchen door!"
8	Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.
9	Nutkin began again--
8	"Authur O'Bower has broken his band, He comes roaring up the land!
8	The King of Scots with all his power, Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!"
9	Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!
9	. . .
1	Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud "Squeak!"
7	The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.
7	When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.
9	* * * * * * * *
1	BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!
9	This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.
5	And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--
5	"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!"
9	Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.
9	They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
9	But one day their mother--Mrs.
9	Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.
9	First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
9	Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).
9	Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).
5	Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.
9	Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.
9	Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off.
9	His mother sewed them on again.
9	When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.
5	"Now keep your frocks clean, children!
9	You must walk on your hind legs.
9	Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks."
9	Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.
9	Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
9	When they stood up there were several green smears!
9	"Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall," said Moppet.
9	They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.
9	Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.
9	He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left.
9	He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.
9	Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.
9	While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
9	They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.
9	Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.
8	Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
9	Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.
9	"Come!
9	Mr. Drake Puddle-duck," said Moppet.
9	"Come and help us to dress him!
9	Come and button up Tom!"
9	Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.
1	But he put them on HIMSELF!
9	They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.
8	"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.
9	And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
9	Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
5	She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
5	"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
9	She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.
9	Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: NOT in the least.
2	Somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.
9	And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!
9	As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
9	The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.
9	And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.
9	Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.
9	She lived in a bank under a hedge.
9	Such a funny house!
9	There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store- rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.
9	There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.
9	Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.
9	Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
2	"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.
9	And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.
1	"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird!
1	Fly away home to your children!"
9	Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.
9	"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?"
2	Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!"
9	She bundled the spider out at a window.
9	He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner.
9	All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.
9	"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?
2	I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."
8	Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!" said the bumble bee.
0	She wished that she had a broom.
9	"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees- wax.
9	But what are you doing down here?
2	Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"
5	Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
5	"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak.
9	She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.
9	But it was full of untidy dry moss.
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
9	Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.
5	"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
5	"I will have them turned out --" "Buzz!
9	Buzz!
9	Buzzz!"--"I wonder who would help me?"
9	"Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"
9	--"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.
9	When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.
8	He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.
9	He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.
9	"How do you do, Mr. Jackson?
1	Deary me, you have got very wet!"
8	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
9	I'll sit awhile and dry myself," said Mr. Jackson.
8	He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
9	He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?
9	First she offered him cherry- stones.
8	"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
9	No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!" said Mr. Jackson.
9	He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
9	Then she offered him thistle- down seed--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
9	Pouff, pouff, puff." said Mr. Jackson.
9	He blew the thistle- down all over the room.
8	"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
8	Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"
0	"I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
8	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, "I can SMELL it; that is why I came to call."
9	Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.
9	Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.
9	When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.
9	"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"
9	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
9	First he squeezed into the pantry.
1	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly?
1	No honey?
1	No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"
9	There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.
9	Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.
9	Then he squeezed into the larder.
9	Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
1	"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!"
2	"And without any invitation!" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.
9	They went along the sandy passage--"Tiddly, widdly--" "Buzz!
9	Wizz!
9	Wizz!"
9	He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.
2	"I do not like bumble bees.
2	They are all over bristles," said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve.
5	"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
5	"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
9	She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.
9	He seemed to have no objection to stings.
9	When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.
9	She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees- wax.
9	Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.
5	"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"
9	She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom.
9	But she was too tired to do any more.
9	First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.
9	Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort- night.
9	She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons.
9	When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.
9	He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.
9	So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.
8	He sat outside in the sun, and said--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
8	Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
9	Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent.
9	She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!
9	On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.
9	She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.
9	Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.
9	She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets.
9	She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.
9	It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages.
9	Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase.
9	Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night-- especially cheese and bacon.
7	Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
9	While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.
9	The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.
9	They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
8	They patted it with their little soft paws--"Shall we make dear little muffins?" said Mittens to Moppet.
7	But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
7	Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
9	The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.
0	I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.
9	Where have you looked for him?"
0	"All over the house!
0	The rats are too many for me.
5	What a thing it is to have an unruly family!" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
5	"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him, too!
9	What is all that soot in the fender?"
1	"The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!
1	"They have both got out of the cupboard!"
9	Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
9	They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards.
9	They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
9	They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.
0	"Yes, it is infested with rats," said Tabitha tearfully.
9	"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday.
9	And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat-- Cousin Ribby.
9	I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.
9	Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
9	They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
9	But there was nothing to be seen.
9	They returned to the kitchen.
1	"Here's one of your kittens at least," said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.
9	They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
7	She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
9	The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
9	Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!
9	"Which way did she go, Moppet?"
7	But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
9	Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.
9	They went into the dairy.
9	The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.
9	They tipped over the jar, and she scrambled out.
7	"Oh, Mother, Mother!" said Mittens--
7	"Oh!
9	Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.
1	"A rolling pin and butter!
7	Oh, my poor son Thomas!" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.
9	"A rolling pin?" said Ribby.
9	"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"
9	Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again.
9	Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
7	"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha," said Ribby.
7	"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."
9	Now, this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.
9	Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
9	When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.
9	He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.
9	The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.
9	Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.
9	It was a big old- fashioned fireplace.
9	The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
9	So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
9	He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.
9	Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.
9	Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
9	He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.
7	"I cannot go back.
7	If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."
9	The chimney was a very big old- fashioned one.
9	It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
9	The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.
7	Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
9	He climbed up, and up, and up.
9	Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
9	He was like a little sweep himself.
7	It was most confusing in the dark.
9	One flue seemed to lead into another.
7	There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.
9	He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
9	There were some mutton bones lying about.
9	"This seems funny," said Tom Kitten.
9	"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?
7	I wish I had never come!
7	And what a funny smell?
7	It is something like mouse, only dreadfully strong.
9	It makes me sneeze," said Tom Kitten.
9	He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.
9	He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.
9	All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.
1	When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.
9	It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.
9	Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.
5	"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.
7	"Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping," said poor Tom Kitten.
5	"Anna Maria!
5	Anna Maria!" squeaked the rat.
9	There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
1	All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening.
9	. .
9	. . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.
9	Anna Maria did the tying.
9	The old rat watched her and took snuff.
9	When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.
8	"Anna Maria," said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers), "Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."
9	"It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin," said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.
5	"No," said Samuel Whiskers, "make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."
5	Butter and dough," replied Anna Maria.
9	The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
9	Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.
9	He did not meet anybody.
9	He made a second journey for the rolling pin.
9	He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.
9	He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.
9	They did not see him.
9	Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
9	She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.
9	She did not observe Moppet.
7	While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
9	But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.
9	Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.
9	It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles.
9	It did not offer to assist him.
7	Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
9	Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
9	First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.
9	"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?" inquired Samuel Whiskers.
5	Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry.
9	She laid hold of his ears.
5	Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly.
9	The rats each held an end.
2	"His tail is sticking out!
2	You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."
5	"I fetched as much as I could carry," replied Anna Maria.
5	"I do not think"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding.
2	It smells sooty."
1	Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!
7	"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once.
0	"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.
2	"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."
9	"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane," said Anna Maria.
9	"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."
9	So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
5	But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.
9	Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.
8	The cat family had quite recovered.
9	They invited him to stay to dinner.
9	The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.
9	They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.
0	John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen coops.
9	And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.
9	They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
9	Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
5	Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.
9	She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.
9	I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!
9	They went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow.
9	After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.
5	As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.
9	There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!
9	They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.
9	And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers-- children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
9	There is no end to them!
9	Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
9	They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment.
9	They charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably.
9	They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.
7	But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--
9	A Mouse.
9	Once upon a time there was a village shop.
9	The name over the window was "Ginger and Pickles."
9	It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls-- Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.
9	The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits.
9	Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.
9	They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.
9	In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops.
9	Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.
9	Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier.
7	The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.
7	The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.
9	Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.
2	"I cannot bear," said he, "to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."
9	"I have the same feeling about rats," replied Pickles, "but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's."
0	"On the contrary, they would go nowhere," replied Ginger gloomily.
9	(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village.
9	She did not give credit.)
9	But there is no money in what is called the "till."
9	Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.
9	Now the meaning of "credit" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time.
9	And Pickles makes a low bow and says, "With pleasure, madam," and it is written down in a book.
7	The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.
9	The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers.
9	But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.
9	But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.
9	As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.
9	Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.
9	They ate them by candle- light after the shop was closed.
7	"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned.
0	I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office;" said Pickles.
9	"The place is full of policemen.
9	I met one as I was coming home.
9	"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon."
9	"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all," replied Ginger.
9	When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license.
7	"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police," said Pickles.
9	"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog."
2	"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--
9	"Where are all the cream crackers?"
9	"You have eaten them yourself." replied Ginger.
9	Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.
9	They did accounts.
9	They added up sums and sums, and sums.
9	"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three- quarters of snuff since October.
9	"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?"
9	"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'" replied Ginger.
5	Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.
5	"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, "he's only a German doll!"
9	The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.
5	Pickles barked till he was hoarse.
9	But still the policeman took no notice.
9	He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.
9	After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door.
9	They came out of the back parlor.
9	There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!
9	At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
9	The policeman had disappeared.
9	But the envelope remained.
9	"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman?
7	I am afraid it is a summons," said Pickles.
9	"No," replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, "it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4." [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]
9	They put up the shutters, and left.
9	But they have not removed from the neighborhood.
9	In fact some people wish they had gone further.
9	Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].
9	I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.
9	Pickles is at present a game- keeper.
9	After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.
9	But they did not keep "self- fitting sixes"; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.
9	The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.
9	Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.
9	Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.
9	But a person cannot live on "seed wigs" and sponge cake and butter buns--not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy's!
9	And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.
9	And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but "very snug;" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.
9	Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.
8	So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--"Henny's Opening Sale!
9	Grand cooperative Jumble!
9	Penny's penny prices!
9	Come buy, come try, come buy!"
9	The poster really was most 'ticing.
9	There was a rush upon the opening day.
9	The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit cannisters.
5	Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.
9	And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.
8	There is something to please everybody.
9	Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes.
9	He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.
8	Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."
9	Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."
9	"Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring- time," replied prudent Timothy.
9	When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.
9	Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.
9	Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
9	They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.
9	When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside.
9	"How shall you ever get them out again?
1	It is like a money box!" said Goody.
8	"I shall be much thinner before springtime, my love," said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.
9	They did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them!
9	Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.
9	The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
9	He began to dig, and he could not remember.
9	And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight.
9	And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!
9	Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders.
9	There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.
5	The first one sang--"Who's bin digging-up MY nuts?
5	Who's-been- digging-up MY nuts?"
5	And another sang--"Little bita bread and-NO-cheese!
5	Little bit-a- bread an'-NO-cheese!"
9	The squirrels followed and listened.
5	The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--"Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts?
5	Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"
9	Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer.
9	It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.
5	But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts.
7	The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!
5	Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting-- "Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"
9	They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in.
9	The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure.
9	They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.
5	"We will leave him here till he confesses," said Silvertail Squirrel and he shouted into the hole--"Who's- been-digging-up MY-nuts?"
9	Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself.
9	Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home.
9	She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.
7	Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night.
9	Next morning she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.
9	She wandered all over the wood, calling--
0	"Timmy Tiptoes!
0	Timmy Tip- toes!
0	Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"
9	In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses.
0	Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.
9	There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?
8	It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.
9	The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--"Besides, I found a few buried!"
8	It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
9	While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities --"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself?
7	My wife will be anxious!"
9	"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you," said the Chipmunk.
9	Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!
9	Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.
9	She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again.
9	She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down.
9	Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.
0	"It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me.
9	What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"
9	"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here," said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; "but where is Chippy Hackee?
0	My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."
9	"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me," said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.
9	She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.
8	Down below there was a noise of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--
9	"My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about?
9	Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"
9	"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole," said Goody Tiptoes.
9	"Yes, I could," said the Chipmunk, "but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"
9	Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--
9	"For the diddlum day Day diddle durn di!
9	Day diddle diddle dum day!"
9	Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--"Timmy Tiptoes!
5	Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"
9	And Timmy replied, "Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?
9	Why, certainly!"
8	He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.
8	Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.
9	And so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.
9	Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.
9	But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.
9	At last a large bear came walking through the wood.
9	Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.
7	Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
0	And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.
9	And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock.
9	And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--"Who's-been-digging- up MY-nuts?
9	Who's been dig- ging-up MY-nuts?"
9	But nobody ever answers!
9	Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
9	They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.
9	"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."
9	"Now run along, and don't get into mischief.
9	I am going out."
9	Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's.
9	She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
9	Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;
9	But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!
9	First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
0	And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
1	But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
5	Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."
7	Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
9	He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
9	After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.
9	It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.
0	Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
9	Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.
9	And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can.
9	It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.
9	Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower- pot.
9	He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.
9	Presently Peter sneezed-- "Kertyschoo!"
9	Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,
9	And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.
9	The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.
9	He went back to his work.
7	Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
9	Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
9	After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around.
9	He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
9	An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.
9	Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.
9	She only shook her head at him.
0	Peter began to cry.
0	Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.
9	Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans.
9	A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.
9	Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.
1	He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.
7	Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
9	But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.
9	The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
9	His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!
9	Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.
9	Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.
1	He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
9	Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
9	Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
9	He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes.
9	His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
1	It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
0	I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
9	His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!
9	"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."
9	But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
9	Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
9	In walks the little dog--says "Pussy are you there?
9	How do you do Mistress Pussy?
9	Mistress Pussy, how do you do?"
8	"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!" [Old Rhyme]
9	Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.
8	"Come in good time, my dear Duchess," said Ribby's letter, "and we will have something so very nice.
9	I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim.
8	You never tasted anything so good!
8	And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!" wrote Ribby.
9	"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby," wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--"I hope it isn't mouse?"
9	And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse" and changed it to "I hope it will be fine," and she gave her letter to the postman.
9	But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.
7	"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!" said Duchess to herself--"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie.
7	And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party.
9	And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
9	A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's."
9	Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.
8	"Oh what a good idea!
8	Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?"
9	Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven.
9	There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open.
9	Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.
9	"The top oven bakes too quickly," said Ribby to herself.
9	Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth.
9	Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.
9	Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.
9	When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.
9	When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.
9	Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.
9	And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.
9	Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth.
9	They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.
9	As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!
9	Straight away to Ribby's house!
8	Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.
9	Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins.
9	Then she went home.
9	There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.
9	But there was nobody there.
9	Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.
1	"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in!
1	And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
9	I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.
9	I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams," said Duchess, "but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse!
9	I cannot think what she has done with it?
1	I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"
9	Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.
9	Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.
9	She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob.
9	She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.
9	She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.
8	"I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven," said Ribby, "the top one would certainly have been very much too hot."
9	Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party.
9	At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity.
9	"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" inquired Duchess in the porch.
8	"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?" cried Ribby.
8	"I hope I see you well?"
8	"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?" said Duchess.
8	"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"
8	"Oh, what lovely flowers!
8	Yes, it is mouse and bacon!"
9	"I think it wants another five minutes," said Ribby.
9	"Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait.
9	Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?"
8	"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?"
8	"With pleasure, my dear Duchess."
9	Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--
8	"How good that pie smells!
8	I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse and bacon--"
9	She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.
9	Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.
9	Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.
9	"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade," said Ribby.
9	"I think"--(thought Duchess to herself)--"I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it.
9	What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
9	I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own."
9	The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!
9	Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.
8	"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?" said Ribby.
8	"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan."
9	"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?"
9	"The patty pan that held up the pie-crust," said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.
9	"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess," said Ribby; "I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."
1	"There isn't a patty-pan," said Ribby, looking perplexed.
1	"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?" said Duchess.
7	Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.
9	"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard."
7	Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"
9	"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan."
7	"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!"
9	"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?"
7	"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."
9	"Shall I run for the doctor?"
9	"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand."
9	Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.
9	She found him at the smithy.
9	Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.
7	Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run.
9	It was most conspicuous.
9	All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.
7	But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.
1	"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"
0	She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.
9	The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!
1	Duchess started!
1	She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,-- and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!
8	Duchess drew a long breath--
1	"Then I must have been eating MOUSE!
9	. . .
9	. . .
9	But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!"
7	Duchess reflected--"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby!
9	I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it.
9	When I go home, I will run round and take it away."
9	She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.
8	"I am feeling very much better," said Duchess, waking up with a jump.
8	"I am truly glad to hear it!
9	He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!"
9	"I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse," said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.
9	"It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!"
9	"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby," said Duchess.
9	"Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?"
9	"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess."
8	Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.
9	Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door.
9	Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.
9	Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws.
9	The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.
1	When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard.
1	Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?
9	. . .
1	But MY patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.
1	Well I never did!
9	. . .
9	Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!"
9	Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
9	The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
8	But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!
8	He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--
9	"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
9	"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
9	The Alderman, however, eats salad."
9	Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.
9	The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves.
9	It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
9	Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water.
9	"I know a good place for minnows," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
9	Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.
9	Then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
9	He had the dearest little red float.
9	His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.
9	The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.
2	"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
9	He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.
9	"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
9	A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.
9	Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.
9	Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
7	"I trust that is not a rat," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; "I think I had better get away from here."
9	Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait.
9	There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
1	"A minnow! a minnow!
1	I have him by the nose!" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.
1	But what a horrible surprise!
9	Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!
9	Then he jumped back into the water.
1	A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, "Ow!
1	Ow!
1	Ow!"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!
2	But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.
9	Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.
7	He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters.
8	"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
9	He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner.
9	He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.
9	Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.
9	And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
9	And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!
9	Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
9	She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.
9	Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
8	The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.
7	Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
9	Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
7	Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap.
1	And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig--"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
9	Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.
9	I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
9	I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
5	Cross-patch tried to bite me.
9	"Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up.
9	Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland."
9	"And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow!
9	Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go.
9	Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether."
0	"Yus, yus, yus," said Aunt Pettitoes, "there will be more to eat without them."
9	So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross- patch rode away in a cart.
9	And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market.
9	We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard.
0	Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.
0	Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--
9	"Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
9	Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
9	Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose" --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--"beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs."
0	Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.
8	Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--"Now son Alexander take the hand"--"Wee, wee, wee!" giggled Alexander--"take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
9	Mind--" "Wee, wee, wee!" interrupted Alexander again.
9	"You put me out," said Aunt Pettitoes--"Observe signposts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones--" "And remember," said I impressively, "if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back.
9	Alexander, you are not attending.
9	Here are two licenses permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
9	Attend Alexander.
9	I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman."
0	Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
9	I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper.
9	Then they started.
9	Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did.
9	Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
8	He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--
8	"This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, "This pig had a bit of meat--
9	let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?"
9	Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
9	Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints--"Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?"
9	"But I wish to preserve them for emergencies," said Pigling Bland doubtfully.
8	Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
5	Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up.
5	Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
8	But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--
9	"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
9	"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
9	"What's that, young Sirs?
9	Stole a pig?
9	Where are your licenses?" said the policeman.
9	They had nearly run against him round a corner.
9	Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply--
1	"To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings"--"What's this? this ain't a license?"
7	Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it.
7	"I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!"
9	"It's not likely they let you start without.
9	I am passing the farm.
9	You may walk with me."
9	"Can I come back too?" inquired Pigling Bland.
9	"I see no reason, young Sir; your paper is all right."
7	Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain.
9	But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.
0	To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig.
9	I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
0	Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign-post--"To Market-town 5 miles," "Over the Hills, 4 miles," "To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles."
1	Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.
9	He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain.
9	"I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes," said Pigling Bland.
1	He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!
9	He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.
9	It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.
7	Pigling Bland became frightened and cried "Wee, wee, wee!
7	I can't find my way home!"
9	After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.
9	The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond --in misty distance--lay the hills.
0	He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --"I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.
8	"Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!" clucked a hen on a perch.
5	"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!" scolded the disturbed cockerel.
8	"To market, to market! jiggettyjig!" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
7	Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak.
9	In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.
9	In less than an hour they were all awakened.
9	The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.
9	He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner.
1	He made a singular remark--"Hallo, here's another!" --seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper.
9	Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.
9	The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks.
9	Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.
9	At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out.
8	He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.
9	"This one's come of himself, whatever," said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out.
9	He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.
9	Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands.
9	Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.
5	There was a smothered noise--"Shut up!" said Mr. Piperson.
9	Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.
5	Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- "Be quiet, will ye?" said Mr. Piperson.
9	Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
9	Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.
9	Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third-after glaring at Pigling-- he put away with much scuffling, and locked up.
9	Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.
9	After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal.
9	Besides, the hens had seen this pig.
9	He looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at Pigling.
9	"You may sleep on the rug," said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.
9	Pigling Bland slept like a top.
9	In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer.
9	He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--"You'll likely be moving on again?" said he to Pigling Bland.
9	Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate.
5	Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or "I'll come back and skin ye!" said Mr. Piperson.
9	It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.
7	But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
9	After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up.
9	He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
9	Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.
9	He sang while he worked--
9	"Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys-- "And they all ran to hear him play, "Over the hills and far away!--"
9	Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in--
9	"Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off."
1	Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.
9	After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there.
9	After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole.
9	It was quite quiet.
9	After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door.
9	It was sucked in immediately.
9	In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.
9	When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.
9	Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.
9	He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it.
9	He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.
9	Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.
9	All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--"My name is Pig-wig.
9	Make me more porridge, please!"
1	Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.
8	A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
9	She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.
9	She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--"How did you come here?" asked Pigling Bland.
9	"Stolen," replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full.
9	Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.
9	"What for?"
8	"Bacon, hams," replied Pig- wig cheerfully.
8	"I shall after supper," said Pig- wig decidedly.
8	Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.
9	She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.
9	"You can't go in the dark," said Pigling Bland.
7	Pig-wig looked anxious.
9	"Do you know your way by day- light?"
9	"I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
9	Which way are _you_ going, Mr. Pig?"
9	"To market--I have two pig papers.
0	I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection," said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
8	Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.
9	He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
9	She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.
9	"Only the corners," replied Pig- wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.
7	"I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling," said the alarmed Pigling.
9	Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; "Sing something," she demanded.
9	"I am sorry.
9	. .
0	I have tooth- ache," said Pigling much dismayed.
9	"Then I will sing," replied Pig- wig, "You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty?
9	I have forgotten some of the words."
9	Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her.
8	She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice--
9	"A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; "(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!"
9	She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--
9	"Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; "For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee!
9	"For somehow they couldn't say--
9	Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.
9	Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar.
7	He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
9	Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig- wig.
7	"But it's dark!
7	How can we find our way?"
9	"The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson."
9	"Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it.
9	Come!
7	I can hear them clucking!"
9	Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper.
9	He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
9	There was no garden; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls.
9	They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
9	"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
9	"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
9	"Come Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring."
9	"Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?" inquired Pig-wig.
9	The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills.
9	The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.
9	"That's Westmorland," said Pig- wig.
8	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.
9	"I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."
9	"Have a peppermint?" said Pig-wig.
5	Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
9	"Does your poor toothy hurt?" inquired Pig- wig.
5	Pigling Bland grunted.
9	Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself, and followed the opposite side of the road.
5	"Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing."
9	Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
7	Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.
9	Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart.
9	The reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.
7	"Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run.
7	Don't say one word.
9	Leave it to me.
7	And in sight of the bridge!" said poor Pigling, nearly crying.
7	He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.
9	The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted.
9	He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip.
9	"Hallo?
9	Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.
9	"Are you deaf?
9	Are you going to market?"
9	Pigling nodded slowly.
9	"I thought as much.
9	It was yesterday.
9	Show me your license?"
9	Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.
2	The grocer flicked his whip-- "Papers?
2	Pig license?"
9	Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers.
2	The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied.
1	"This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"
9	Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.
5	The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.
9	Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.
9	"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him," said the grocer, gathering up the reins.
9	He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a VERY lame pig could never run!
7	"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."
9	The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
9	Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.
7	"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!" said Pigling Bland.
9	Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran!
9	They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.
7	Little fat Pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.
9	They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.
8	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!
9	This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse!
9	He is not afraid of a kitten.
1	This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.
1	She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!
9	The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.
9	Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire.
9	The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.
9	He comes sliding down the bellpull.
9	Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.
9	The Mouse comes a little nearer.
9	Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster.
9	The Mouse comes VERY close.
1	And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
2	And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.
9	She ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball.
1	But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
8	He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
9	"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass; And entertain a score or two of tailors." [Richard III]
9	My Dear Freda:
9	Because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, I have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that nobody has read before.
9	And the queerest thing about it is--that I heard it in Gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the tailor, the waistcoat, and the "No more twist!" _Christmas_
9	In the time of swords and peri wigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets--when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a tailor in Gloucester.
9	He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table from morning till dark.
9	All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippetted, piecing out his satin, and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.
9	But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor.
9	He cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--"Too narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice," said the tailor.
9	One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry- coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream- coloured satin waistcoat for the Mayor of Gloucester.
9	The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself: "No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!" said the Tailor of Gloucester.
9	When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window- panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.
9	There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs and buttons, all in order.
9	For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the button- holes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist.
9	And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.
9	The tailor came out of his shop at dark.
9	No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and THEY ran in and out without any keys!
9	For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages.
9	But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow.
9	And although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.
9	He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.
9	"Miaw?" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, "miaw?"
0	The tailor replied: "Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling.
9	Take this groat (which is our last fourpence), and, Simpkin, take a china pipkin, but a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk, and a penn'orth of sausages.
9	And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence but me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk.
0	But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST."
9	Then Simpkin again said "Miaw!" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.
0	The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill.
9	He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.
9	"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat--"
1	Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
9	Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
1	"Now what can that be?" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair.
9	The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles.
1	"This is very peculiar," said the Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.
9	Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a courtesy to the tailor!
9	Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.
9	The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands.
9	But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises--
9	Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
9	Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!
9	And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.
0	The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting: "One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk!
9	To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening.
9	Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin?
9	The little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat.
9	They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.
9	And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house.
9	Not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back.
1	He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups.
1	He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!
5	"Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my TWIST?"
5	But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
0	"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
9	All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!
0	The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: "No more twist! no more twist!"
9	What should become of the cherry- coloured coat?
9	Who should come to sew it, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?
9	Out-of-doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no dinner for Simpkin and the poor old tailor of Gloucester.
0	The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night.
9	But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).
9	When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.
9	From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.
9	Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; and air was quite full of little twittering tunes.
0	But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin.
9	From the tailor's ship in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles.
8	There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily:
9	"Four-and-twenty tailors Went to catch a snail, The best man amongst them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little kyloe cow.
9	Run, tailors, run!
9	Or she'll have you all e'en now!"
9	Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again:
9	"Sieve my lady's oatmeal, Grind my lady's flour, Put it in a chestnut, Let it stand an hour--"
9	"Mew!
9	Mew!" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door.
9	But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.
8	The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--
9	"Three little mice sat down to spin, Pussy passed by and she peeped in.
9	What are you at, my fine little men?
9	Making coats for gentlemen.
9	Shall I come in and cut off yours threads?
9	Oh, no, Miss Pussy, You'd bite off our heads!"
5	"Mew! scratch! scratch!" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout all at once in little twittering voices: "No more twist!
9	No more twist!"
9	And they barred up the window-shutters and shut out Simpkin.
9	Simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind.
8	He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.
9	The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.
0	"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning!
0	The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry- coloured coat?"
9	He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.
1	But there was no one there!
1	Not even one little brown mouse!
9	Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--
9	NO MORE TWIST.
8	And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.
9	He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.
9	Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets!
9	But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.
9	The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat--SO neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.
9	The stitches of those buttonholes were so small--SO small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!
9	It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is "soporific."
9	I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.
9	They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!
9	When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy.
8	They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.
9	I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the "Flopsy Bunnies."
9	As there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.
9	Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
9	When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.
9	Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture.
9	There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.
8	One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had "shot" into flower.
8	The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed themselves with lettuces.
8	By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.
9	Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
9	Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.
8	The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
9	From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine.
9	The blue- bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.
9	(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittle- mouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)
9	She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
9	The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
9	While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!
7	Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag.
7	The mouse hid in a jam pot.
8	The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
8	They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.
9	Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack.
9	He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings.
9	He stared at them for some time.
9	Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
9	Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--
5	"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!" said he as he dropped them into his sack.
8	The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed.
9	They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.
9	Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
9	He went to put away the mowing machine.
9	While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.
9	Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.
9	But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
9	She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
9	The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
9	Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blackingbrush and two decayed turnips.
7	Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.
9	Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.
9	He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.
9	The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
9	They watched him go into his house.
9	And then they crept up to the window to listen.
9	Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.
8	They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--
8	"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!" said Mr. McGregor.
1	"Eh?
1	What's that?
1	What have they been spoiling now?" enquired Mrs. McGregor.
1	"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers --"one, two, three--"
2	"Don't you be silly: what do you mean, you silly old man?"
1	"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!" replied Mr. McGregor.
9	(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the windowsill.)
9	Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it.
9	She said she could feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.
9	"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak."
2	"Line your old cloak?" shouted Mr. McGregor--"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!"
9	"Rabbit tobacco!
8	I shall skin them and cut off their heads."
9	Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.
5	When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
5	She said that Mr. McGregor had "done it a purpose."
5	And Mr. McGregor was very angry too.
9	One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.
9	Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.
9	So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.
9	But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.
9	What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!
5	Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.
5	Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else-- "I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima.
5	You would let them go cold; you know you would!"
5	"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself," quacked Jemima Puddle-duck.
9	She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.
9	She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.
9	She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.
9	She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.
9	When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.
9	She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying.
9	She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.
9	She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.
9	She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.
9	Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place.
8	She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
1	But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.
9	He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.
7	"Quack?" said Jemima Puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--"Quack?"
9	The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--
9	"Madam, have you lost your way?" said he.
9	He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.
9	Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.
9	She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place.
9	"Ah! is that so?
8	Indeed!" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima.
9	He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.
5	Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
8	"Indeed!
8	How interesting!
9	I wish I could meet with that fowl.
9	I would teach it to mind its own business!
9	"But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed.
9	No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way.
9	You may sit there as long as you like," said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
9	He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves.
9	It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.
9	"This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient," said the hospitable gentleman.
9	There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes.
9	The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.
9	The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.
1	Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
1	But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.
9	When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.
0	He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night.
9	He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.
8	He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
9	They were greeny white and very large.
8	The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
8	He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.
9	At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--"and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched.
9	They might catch cold," said the conscientious Jemima.
9	"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.
9	But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat.
8	Let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!
9	"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet?
9	Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley.
9	I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet," said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.
9	She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.
9	And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.
9	The collie dog Kep met her coming out, "What are you doing with those onions?
9	Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"
8	The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.
9	He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.
9	Then he went out, and trotted down the village.
9	He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon.
9	She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.
9	She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
7	He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood.
9	"Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs.
9	Give me the herbs for the omelet.
5	Be sharp!"
7	He was rather abrupt.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.
1	She felt surprised and uncomfortable.
9	While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
9	Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it.
7	Jemima became much alarmed.
9	A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.
9	And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.
9	Presently Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle- duck.
9	Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.
9	He had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping.
0	Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.
9	She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.
9	Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.
9	Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town.
9	She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!
0	One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
0	"I've lost my pocket-handkin!
0	Three handkins and a pinny!
0	Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"
9	The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--
0	"Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?"
9	But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--
9	"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"
9	And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
9	Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.
9	Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!
1	And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.
9	Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!
9	Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.
9	Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup!
9	And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were footmarks of a VERY small person.
9	Lucie ran on, and on.
9	The path ended under a big rock.
1	The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!
9	But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--
9	"Lily-white and clean, oh!
9	With little frills between, oh!
9	Smooth and hot-red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"
9	Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song.
7	A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
9	Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams-- just like any other farm kitchen.
9	Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.
7	There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
9	Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat.
1	Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
9	"Who are you?" said Lucie.
9	"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"
8	The little person made a bob- curtsey--"Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!"
9	And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
9	"What's that thing?" said Lucie- "that's not my pocket-handkin?"
9	"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"
9	And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.
9	Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--"That isn't my pinny?" said Lucie.
9	"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine!
2	It's very bad to wash!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
9	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.
9	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.
8	"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
9	"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"
9	"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!
9	She'll very soon go barefoot!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
9	"Why, there's another hankersniff-- but it isn't mine; it's red?"
2	"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions!
2	I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out that smell."
1	"There's another one of mine," said Lucie.
9	"What are those funny little white things?"
9	"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself."
1	"There's my last pocket-handkin!" said Lucie.
9	"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"
9	"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!" said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle.
9	"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."
9	"What are these dear soft fluffy things?" said Lucie.
9	"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."
9	"Will their jackets take off?" asked Lucie.
9	"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.
9	And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.
9	They're ALWAYS marked at washing!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
9	And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!
9	Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
9	They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
2	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.
9	When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.
9	And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.
9	Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!
9	All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!
8	And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
9	So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.
1	Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say "Good-night," and to thank the washer-woman.--But what a VERY odd thing!
1	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!
9	She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?
9	And HOW small she had grown-- and HOW brown--and covered with PRICKLES!
9	Why!
1	Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG! * * * * * *
9	(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?
9	And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)
9	One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
9	He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.
9	A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.
1	He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.
0	He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
0	Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.
7	Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
8	Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
7	Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
8	He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
8	The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.
7	Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
7	I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.
1	The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
5	Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.
1	When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
1	Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.
8	When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat.
7	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
8	Then they squeaked with joy!
1	The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.
1	"It is not boiled enough; it is hard.
2	"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's," said Hunca Munca.
5	Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
5	Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
5	Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb!
7	The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.
1	What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!
0	Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.
8	The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--"I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"
2	But the nurse said,--"I will set a mouse-trap!"
7	The good Rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole.
0	It feels sad.
8	He thinks it is a very funny bird!
2	The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.
7	One day he was living in a stick- house in the coppice [grove], causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer.
7	Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.
5	He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.
5	He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them.
5	And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter--"I have not had a good square meal for a fort- night, I am living on pig-nuts.
5	I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!" said Tommy Brock.
8	It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
8	So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed cake and "a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine."
8	Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow.
8	Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.
8	And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........
7	Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole.
5	Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.
7	Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.
8	Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
1	Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!" shouted Benjamin Bunny.
1	The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin?
1	Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?"
7	"No, no, no!
7	He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack --have you seen him?"
1	"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?"
7	"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins!
7	Did he come this way?
7	Please tell me quick!"
7	"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"
0	"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;" said Peter reflectively, "but there are two hopeful circumstances.
7	"Which way?"
7	Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of atwitter.
1	"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent.
2	What a nasty person!" said Peter.
7	He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.--"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.
7	Come on, Cousin Benjamin!"
7	When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously.
7	The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.
8	Benjamin sighed with relief.
7	The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
7	Benjamin, who was all of atwitter, pulled Peter off the windowsill.
7	There were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors.
0	But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!
1	And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer.
1	The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!
8	Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.
7	Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely.
7	They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.
5	Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.
5	First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
5	Then the midges had been very bad.
5	And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled.
5	Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
5	As usual, when out of humor, he determined to move house.
5	He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
5	Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.
5	He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
5	Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.
5	The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.
5	His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.
5	When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.
7	But when he was inside --he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.
2	He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
1	It creaked; he turned round with a jump.
7	The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.
8	"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise," said Mr. Tod.
8	The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.
1	At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.
8	Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!
8	"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug.
2	I must have a disinfecting.
8	He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.
5	Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
7	To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.
7	They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.
7	Inside the house the racket was fearful.
7	The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
8	When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.
5	Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks.
5	There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
8	"Now for it!
8	Run in, Cousin Benjamin!
8	Run in and get them! while I watch the door."
7	But Benjamin was frightened--
7	"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"
7	"Yes they are!"
5	At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.
5	After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.
5	Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy.
5	Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair.
7	Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.
7	In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust.
8	"I've got them!
8	Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
0	The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed.
8	He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.
8	Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner.
8	The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.
8	"How beautiful existence is!" said each rose.
8	We have good neighbours, both below and above.
8	How beautiful existence is!"
2	"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother.
2	"Don't you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and you will wear too?
1	I am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, although I did say 'peep' to you pretty loudly.
2	The thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell.
2	I am heartily tired of such neighbours."
8	What a pleasure that must be!
8	It is fine to have such cheerful neighbours."
1	The other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, "Where can she be going to?"
8	The whole day long the sun shines bright and warm, and in the night the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all the little holes in it."
8	"We make it lively about the house," said the sparrow-mother; "and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.
2	But such neighbours as ours!
2	The roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in a hat.
2	You see, that's their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose.
8	But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.
2	"Nothing at all," answered their mother; "that's only something external.
2	If they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.
2	I would have plucked them already if they had not been so big."
8	In the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved each other dearly, were industrious and active, and everything in their home looked very nice.
8	"Now I see that it is Sunday," said the husband, kissing his little wife.
8	They sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them.
2	"This sight is really too tedious," said the sparrow-mother, who could see into the room from her nest; and she flew away.
1	In one of her flights, however it may have happened, she was caught, before she was aware of it, in a horse-hair net which some boys had attached to a tree.
7	The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.
8	He was a merry old man, always wandering about.
7	At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.
7	But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.
7	"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly," said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.
1	How she glittered!
1	All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
7	Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
1	"Look at her!
1	Look at her!" they all cried.
1	"Look at her!
1	Look at her" cried her little ones. as she approached the nest.
1	"That is certainly a young peacock, for it glitters in all colours; it makes one's eyes ache, as mother told us.
1	Peep! that's 'the beautiful'."
0	And then they pecked at the bird with their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to get into the nest; she was so exhausted that she couldn't even say "Peep!" much less "I am your own mother!"
0	"Poor creature!" said all the roses; "only be still, and we will hide you.
1	The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful fresh roses.
5	"But I am the eldest!" exclaimed the third.
5	Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
5	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.
1	In the night the red flames burst through the window and seized the roof, the dry straw blazed up high, and the whole house, together with the young sparrow, was burned.
8	"A pleasanter picture cannot be imagined.
1	"Where is the house?" they asked.
1	"Where is the nest?
1	All is burned and our strong brother too.
2	I don't want to talk to them, and it looks miserable here- that's my opinion."
8	"They are sparrows, and good creatures.
8	"Here is excellent fare!" said the sparrow.
2	"Do you see that pouter pigeon?" said one to the other.
2	She eats too many, and the best ones too.
2	How she lifts her crest, the ugly, spiteful creature!
0	The sparrows ate lustily; they listened attentively, and even stood in the ranks with the others, but it did not suit them at all.
8	They were full, and so they left the pigeons, exchanging opinions about them, slipped in under the garden palings, and when they found the door leading into the house open, one of them, who was more than full, and therefore felt brave, hopped on to the threshold.
1	"Peep!" said the sparrows, "it's nothing.
2	It only looks like something.
1	Peep! that is 'the beautiful.'
8	The pigeons had often cooed, not to say growled- the spiteful creatures; the sparrows had been frozen in winter and had lived merrily in summer: they were all betrothed, or married, or whatever you like to call it.
8	The windows of the house were broader at the bottom than at the top, and when the sparrows looked through them, every room appeared to them like a tulip with the brightest colours and shades.
8	"How it shines! how it shines!" said the maiden sparrow.
8	"I suppose that is 'the beautiful.'
1	A "peep" and three foot-scrapings- in this way she had often greeted throughout the year, and no one here had responded, for those who are once parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a habit with her.
8	Good-day! good-day!"
8	This is 'the beautiful.'
8	All stood with enraptured faces round Thorwaldsen's grave, and a few picked up the fallen rose-leaves and preserved them.
1	"Peep!" they said sweeping the ground with their tails, and blinking with one eye at the roses, they had not looked at them long before they were convinced that they were their old neighbours.
8	The painter who had drawn the rose-bush near the ruined house, had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up, and had given it to the architect, for finer roses had never been seen.
8	The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.
8	"How glorious it is to live and to bloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces every day.
8	It is as if every day were a festival."
8	Peep! how they have got on.
1	THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees.
8	The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take.
7	His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds.
0	But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.
8	The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: "What a mighty prince!
8	No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed it."
1	The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city.
0	These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers' feet when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left.
2	"Then I will conquer God too."
5	"I will conquer God!" said the prince.
5	"I have sworn it: my will must be done!"
5	They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
5	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
0	"Who is the dead man?" we asked.
0	"They say that he was once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages, and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink, body and mind.
0	When at last he had ruined his health, they brought him into the country, where someone paid for his board and residence.
5	He was gentle as a child as long as the sullen mood did not come over him; but when it came he was fierce, became as strong as a giant, and ran about in the wood like a chased deer.
0	But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.
0	God knows what was in his mind; but he requested us to put the book into his coffin, and now he lies there.
0	In a little while the lid will be placed upon the coffin, and he will have sweet rest in the grave!"
8	The cloth which covered his face was lifted up; the dead man's face expressed peace- a sunbeam fell upon it.
0	What a strange feeling it is- surely we all know it- to look through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows.
8	He fixed the leaf to the student's cap in the green wood, when they vowed eternal friendship.
0	Where does he dwell now?
0	The leaf is kept, but the friendship does no longer exist.
0	Here is a water-lily that he had plucked himself, and watered with salt tears- a lily of sweet water.
0	What might he have thought when he plucked and kept it?
0	The lilac bends its fresh fragrant flowers over the dead man's head; the swallow passes again- "twit, twit;" now the men come with hammer and nails, the lid is placed over the dead man, while his head rests on the dumb book- so long cherished, now closed for ever!
5	"He annoys me with his loud crowing," said the Portuguese duck; "but, still, he's a handsome bird, there's no denying that, although he's not a drake.
8	How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
2	"That's just like the cat, she's a villain," said the Portuguese duck.
2	How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander about upon the roofs.
0	She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all the other ducks who were not Portuguese.
0	"Poor little creature!" they said, one after another, as they came up.
8	"Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, "You are very kind-hearted, madam;" but he did not wish for a second bath.
8	"I have never thought about my heart," replied the Portuguese duck, "but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings.
2	"Don't plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; "he requires rest and nursing.
1	"Oh, no! no! pray let me dry," implored the little bird.
8	"Amusement, too, is very beneficial.
8	The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing-bird.
8	"He's charming," they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: "We are of the same race as yourself," they said.
2	It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong.
2	That fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles.
5	"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about," whispered one duck to another; "they are always doing it, and it annoys me.
8	So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep.
8	The sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very good place.
2	The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a "doting ducky," All the other ducks laughed at this.
8	And then they repeated the former joke about "Portulak," and declared it was most amusing.
1	The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the other side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.
5	"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she retorted, "you must not be so touchy.
8	When she had finished, she lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began to sing,-
5	"Now I want rest after my dinner," said the Portuguese; "you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here.
5	When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.
5	"Give that to a chicken," she said, "and don't be always standing in my way."
5	"Done!" repeated the Portuguese duck, "your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite.
0	"It was sunshine here yesterday," said the little bird, "but to-day it is cloudy and the air is close."
7	"But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday."
5	"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: "would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?
2	There's not a drop of malicious blood in me.
5	So saying, she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground.
2	"she said; "could he not bear even such a little peck as I gave him?
2	Then certainly he was not made for this world.
5	"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried, "it's all your fault.
5	He's lost his life, and I'm very near losing mine."
0	There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, even the two Chinese.
0	"We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
8	"It must look very grand," thought he, "for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest.
2	"Never mind what they say; you need not listen," said the mother.
2	But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join with them at all.
7	"But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.
7	"Shall we be hanged and roasted?" asked the young storks.
2	"No, certainly not," said the mother.
1	"Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark! they are singing again."
2	"Listen to me, and not to them," said the mother stork.
1	"Oh, o- h!" cried the young storks.
5	"I don't want to fly," said one of the young storks, creeping back into the nest.
5	"I don't care about going to warm countries."
2	"Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes?" said the mother, "or till the boys comes to hang you, or to roast you?- Well then, I'll call them."
7	"Oh no, no," said the young stork, jumping out on the roof with the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third day could fly a little.
5	"Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?" asked the young storks.
8	That last flap of the wings was so easy and graceful, that I shall give you permission to fly with me to-morrow to the marshes.
8	You must strut about proudly- it will look well and make you respected."
5	"But may we not punish those naughty boys?" asked the young storks.
5	"We will revenge ourselves," whispered the young storks to each other, as they again joined the exercising.
5	The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.
8	"Yes, certainly," cried the mother stork.
8	"I have thought upon the best way to be revenged.
5	"But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall we do to him?" cried the young storks.
0	"We will take it to the naughty boy, and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead brother.
8	This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there.
8	"I sing so," he said, "that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card house of their own, would become thinner than they are with envy if they were to hear me."
1	That was very mean.
5	The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.
7	"I only hope he's not become unwell," said the Yard Dog, and then he smelt at him again.
5	"I jumped highest, after all," said the Flea.
2	Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick.
5	I jumped to the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen."
5	And he too said, "Body is required! body is required!"
0	And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.
0	In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.
8	"How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell.
0	I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest.
5	"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break.
8	But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw?
1	It was very large and ugly.
1	The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
1	"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself!
0	"See, children, that is the way of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself.
5	The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.
2	"Yes, but he is so big and ugly," said the spiteful duck "and therefore he must be turned out."
2	"The others are very pretty children," said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, "all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little."
2	"That is impossible, your grace," replied the mother; "he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others.
0	"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
2	The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born.
0	"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said.
0	Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
1	"You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."
8	After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy.
8	"Listen, friend," said one of them to the duckling, "you are so ugly, that we like you very well.
1	"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.
7	How they terrified the poor duckling!
8	He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."
7	It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move.
8	She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
1	"Oh what a prize!" she exclaimed, "I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs.
2	"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking."
0	So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
2	"What an absurd idea," said the hen.
2	"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies.
8	"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."
2	"Delightful, indeed!" said the hen, "why you must be crazy!
2	Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here.
2	But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable.
0	All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
1	The duckling had never seen any like them before.
1	As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them.
7	He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself.
8	Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
7	The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
7	Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
0	The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.
0	It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.
0	The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
0	"I will fly to those royal birds," he exclaimed, "and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter."
8	The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.
0	"Kill me," said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.
1	His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.
8	He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
8	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
8	Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty."
8	Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
2	"Your 'something' is not enough for me," said the second brother; "what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is journeyman's work, or might even be done by a machine.
2	No!
2	"I call it all nothing," said the third; "not in reality any position.
2	"Not in my opinion," said the fourth; "I will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done.
1	People said of this fifth brother, "There is something very precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does nothing."
1	The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.
8	"While young, I can wander without a care, And build new houses everywhere; Fair and bright are my dreams of home, Always thought of wherever I roam.
8	Hurrah for a workman's life of glee!
8	It was really a pretty house, and in it were a happy pair.
8	The flag of the corporation fluttered before it, and the journeymen and apprentices shouted "Hurrah."
2	"It is evidently for the sake of contrast that I and this wretched soul should arrive here exactly at the same time," said the critic.
5	"In what manner did you leave the world?" he asked, just for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand there and wait.
1	"How I left the world?" she replied; "why, I can scarcely tell you.
7	I lay looking at the cloud till I observed a little black spot in the middle of it, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what it meant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is not often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering seized me.
8	Twice in my life had I seen this same thing, and I knew that there would be an awful storm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry.
7	I was so alarmed, that I felt more strength and life than I had done for some time.
8	I saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice; I saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind; I heard the boys shouting, 'Hurrah!' and the lads and lasses singing, and everything full of merriment and joy.
7	I cried out as loudly as I could, but no one heard me; I was too far off from the people.
7	Soon would the storm burst, the ice break, and all who were on it be irretrievably lost.
0	They could not hear me, and to go to them was quite out of my power.
0	Oh, if I could only get them safe on land!
0	I escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could go no farther.
0	The flames rushed out towards me, flickered on the window, and rose high above the roof.
7	The people on the ice became aware of the fire, and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick woman, who, as they thought, was being burnt to death.
8	But the people had reached the sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round.
8	I had saved them all; but I suppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up here to the gates of paradise.
8	"See," said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, "this is what the poor woman has brought.
2	I know thou hast accomplished nothing, not even made a single brick.
2	But thou canst not return to earth, and I can do nothing for thee."
7	She said, "His brother made all the stone and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling, which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me.
7	Could not all these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him?
0	It was the hour of the mother's sorrow, when there pealed forth from the church tower the sound of festive bells.
8	In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.
8	The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day.
8	Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
0	He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
8	His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
8	He bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass and nettles.
0	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.
0	Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.
8	An old maid stood at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily.
8	"Yes, it's all very well for you to sing," said the bottle neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.
2	"Yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as I have: you wouldn't sing then, I know.
0	I have no reason to sing, nor could I sing now if I were ever so happy; but when I was a whole bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn't I sing then?
8	The little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply.
1	The bottle did not behold the light of day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant's cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, which caused some very curious sensations.
8	"Ah, how beautiful is life."
8	All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young poet's brain, who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him.
8	She was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes.
0	There had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed, and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the furrier's daughter did not wear a very joyful expression.
8	It remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.
1	What a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time!
8	"Long life to the betrothed," cried the papa, and every glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his beautiful bride.
8	"Happiness and blessing to you both," said the old people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses again.
8	"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year," he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, "Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!"
2	"I gave them wine, and they gave me muddy water," he had said to himself, "but I suppose it was all well meant."
8	He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing.
8	Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark," "Peter Jensen's lark."
0	At the last moment, when the ship was sinking, the young mate wrote on a piece of paper, "We are going down: God's will be done."
1	"What trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder!" said one, and very likely it is broken after all."
1	But the bottle was not broken, and, better still, it understood every word that was said: this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine merchant's; in the forest and on the ship,- it was the only good old language it could understand.
8	It had returned home, and the language was as a welcome greeting.
8	For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.
8	"There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."
8	It never occurred to him to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.
8	The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.
8	Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors.
8	It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental.
8	It seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again.
8	Not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities.
8	She was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may.
8	The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.
8	Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted "Hurrah."
8	"This is a wonderful journey up into the air," thought the bottle; "it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear of striking against anything."
1	Then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done, made somersaults in the air, and felt itself quite young and unfettered, although it was half full of wine.
8	Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.
8	Do you see how splendidly the tree has grown?
0	It has been raised from only a little sprig of myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal, and from which I was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed: but that day never came; the eyes were closed which were to have been my light and joy through life.
8	Before the sprig you gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter."
8	At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight.
8	Certainly it was a very good house to look at for amusement.
0	The little boy one day heard his parents say, "The old man opposite is very well off, but is terribly lonely."
8	And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.
2	Oh dear, how I am creaking.
2	Gout in my back, ugh."
8	"Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend," said the old man, "and thank you also for coming to see me."
8	"Thanks, thanks," or "Creak, creak," said all the furniture.
8	"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."
8	It was very pleasant, certainly, to be in that old house.
0	"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, "it is so lonely and dull here.
0	I have been accustomed to live in a family, and I cannot get used to this life.
0	I cannot bear it.
8	It is not here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and mother talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear children made such a delightful noise.
0	No, it is all lonely in the old man's house.
0	Oh, I cannot bear it."
0	"Ah, but I never see any, and I don't know them," said the tin soldier, "and I cannot bear it."
8	Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.
8	How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.
0	"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.
0	Let me go to the wars, and lose an arm or a leg, that would be some change; I cannot bear it.
0	I have had visits from mine, and you may believe me it is not altogether pleasant.
8	You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was not right to laugh.
0	Ah, really he must be very happy; I cannot endure this life."
8	Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
0	"I will go to the wars!
0	I will go to the wars!" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the floor.
1	And indeed nobody was home, for the old man was dead.
0	He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.
8	The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
8	He was just married, and had come, with his young wife, to reside in the new house with the garden in front of it, and now he stood there by her side while she planted a field flower that she thought very pretty.
1	"Oh dear, what was that?" she exclaimed, as something pricked her.
1	It was- only think!- it was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost up in the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have been for many years.
8	And the tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit.
8	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."
0	"Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been," said she.
8	"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier; "still it is delightful not to be forgotten."
8	The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "Visitors are coming" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.
8	"Oh, how nicely it is made," exclaimed the ladies.
8	"It is more than nice," said the emperor, "it is charming."
1	"For shame, pa," she said, "it is not artificial, it is natural!"
2	"For shame, it is natural" repeated all her ladies.
8	"Superbe, charmant," said the ladies of the court, for they all prattled French, one worse than the other.
0	"You are right," said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.
8	But the prince was not discouraged.
8	When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.
8	"That is the tune I know," she exclaimed.
2	"God forbid," said the lady.
2	"It is very naughty," said the princess, and walked off.
2	"That is tiresome," said the princess.
8	That was a pleasure!
8	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
8	"But that is superbe," said the princess passing by.
8	"I have never heard a more beautiful composition.
2	"I believe he is mad," said the princess, and walked off, but soon she stopped.
2	"But we do not like to kiss him" said the ladies.
2	"The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think.
1	"What does this mean?" he said, when he saw that his daughter was kissing the swineherd, and then hit their heads with his shoe just as the swineherd received the sixty-eighth kiss.
5	"Go out of my sight," said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.
0	There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.
0	"Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!" said the princess, "I wish I had accepted the prince.
0	Oh, how wretched I am!"
5	"I have now learnt to despise you," he said.
2	"You refused an honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a swineherd for his toys; you have no one but yourself to blame!"
8	And then she can tell the most wonderful stories.
8	She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.
8	Why, when grandmother's tears fall upon the rose, and she is looking at it, the rose revives, and fills the room with its fragrance; the walls vanish as in a mist, and all around her is the glorious green wood, where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage; and grandmother, why she is young again, a charming maiden, fresh as a rose, with round, rosy cheeks, fair, bright ringlets, and a figure pretty and graceful; but the eyes, those mild, saintly eyes, are the same,- they have been left to grandmother.
8	At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles.
0	Grandmother cannot smile like that now.
8	We could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace.
8	It was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine.
8	She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.
8	She was laid in a black coffin, looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen, though her eyes were closed; but every wrinkle had vanished, her hair looked white and silvery, and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile.
8	They are better off than we are; the dead return no more.
8	But over the grave fresh roses bloom, the nightingale sings, and the organ sounds and there still lives a remembrance of old grandmother, with the loving, gentle eyes that always looked young.
1	It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws.
0	In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering.
0	He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
1	The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, "Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to run;" and away he started for a most wonderful ride.
7	The metallic groups of figures, among which were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square.
8	The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
8	But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors.
8	As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly.
8	One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
8	The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.
8	They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."
8	The older people stand as if uncertain, yet hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus.
8	The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
8	"Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal," said the little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps.
8	"Thanks to yourself also," replied the Metal Pig; "I have helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run.
0	Yes; as you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.
7	Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be lifeless, as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa."
8	"I will stay with you, my dear creature," said the little boy.
1	The boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him.
1	The wind whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses- then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.
7	Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
0	Once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it.
1	Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy.
7	"Don't be angry," he pleaded; "I received nothing, I have nothing at all;" and he seized his mother's dress and would have kissed it.
1	This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with her elbow.
5	"Certainly you must have some money," she said.
0	The boy began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.
2	"Felicita," she said, "what are you doing to the child?"
5	"The child is mine," she answered; "I can murder him if I like, and you too, Giannina."
5	And then she swung about the fire-pot.
7	The boy rushed out at the sight, sped across the courtyard, and fled from the house.
0	Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
0	Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
8	A little white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the boy.
8	"Innocent souls are soon intimate," said the woman, as she caressed both the boy and the dog.
8	These good people gave the child food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go and speak to his mother.
8	A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
0	He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
8	Then she said, "He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, he may become a clever glovemaker, like you.
8	So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
1	Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat.
0	But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already.
8	They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.
5	"Why don't you go?" said the painter.
8	"You happy creature," he said; "how I have longed for you! we must take a ride to-night."
1	But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth.
1	He looked down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking as if she would have said, "Here I am too; why are you sitting there?"
7	A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.
1	"Bellissima in the street, and not dressed!" as the old lady called it; "what would be the end of this?"
0	The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.
1	"Where have you stolen that pretty dog?" they asked; and they took it away from him.
7	The boy did not know whether he had better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess everything.
7	They would certainly kill him, he thought.
7	"Bellissima in the watch-house!" she cried.
5	"You bad boy! how did you entice her out?
7	Poor little delicate thing, with those rough policemen! and she'll be frozen with cold."
0	Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.
5	The painter, however, consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady's anger; but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with Bellissima, who had been with the police.
8	Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.
8	Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too.
8	Oh, nothing could be more delightful.
8	The first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.
8	Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.
8	A second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent.
8	His collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: "Stand still," cried he, "and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst my collection."
5	He tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.
5	"You wicked boy! the poor little creature!" was all she could utter.
5	She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade him to enter the house again.
0	A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had- died.
0	Fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back.
2	"She's thick, and fat and ugly," said the young green Frogs; "and her children will be just as ugly as she is."
2	The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water.
8	"Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it," said the Mother-Toad.
2	"Quack!" said the little Toad; and that's just as if one of us were to say, "Aha!"
2	"You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one while."
8	"It's much nicer here than down in the well!
8	I should like to stay here my whole life long!" said the little Toad.
8	"It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so."
8	"It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well, and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty road.
8	"It will be too damp for you here," said the Frogs; "but you are very welcome!
8	But it doesn't matter; you are equally welcome."
5	I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."
1	How great it is! how bright it is!
1	Oh, how it seems to shine in my head!
8	But I haven't the jewel; not that I cry about that- no, I must go higher up, into splendor and joy!
7	I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid.
7	It's a difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken.
8	Onward, therefore, straight onward!"
1	"What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew! and how beautiful and great the world is!
1	"How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!"
2	It hides half the world from me, but I don't care for the world."
2	"It doesn't do that with a good will," thought the Fowl, and lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.
7	The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight up towards the Fowl.
1	"Aha, it has allies," quoth the Fowl.
2	"Just look at the crawling thing!"
2	"I don't care for the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat."
8	"I writhed myself free," said the Caterpillar.
8	"What a good thing it is when one has presence of mind!
0	And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy.
8	She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.
8	Nothing is so beautiful as property.
8	"Yes, higher up," said the little Toad; "higher-up!
1	"How high up they live!" thought the Toad.
1	"If one could only get as high as that!"
8	"But it's so wonderfully ugly," persisted the first.
1	"A jewel!" cried the naturalist.
8	"What a good thing that I have not got it!
2	"Man is the most conceited creature!" said the Stork.
2	"Listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly.
2	They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language!
2	It makes my beak turn cold when I think of it.
2	The world could get on without men.
1	"What a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits!
1	Higher than ever I saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim!" she cried, as the Stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions.
8	"I must go to Egypt!" said she.
8	"If the Stork or one of his young ones would only take me!
8	Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!
8	All the longing and all the pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's head."
8	The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward towards Egypt- and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemed to fly out of them.
1	"Quunk!- ah!"
8	WE are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the servants, the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity.
8	For on this day a son and heir has been born, and mother and child are doing well.
8	Everything invited to slumber, everything had a charming look of repose; and so the nurse had discovered, for she slept; and well she might sleep, while everything around her told of happiness and blessing.
8	"Everything has been bestowed here," said the guardian angel.
2	"Wanting!" cried the guardian angel; "nothing must be wanting here; and if it is so, let us fetch it; let us seek the powerful fairy; let us go to her."
5	"Her pearl must not be missing; it must be there, that the crown, when worn, may be complete.
0	Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.
0	The silence which reigned here expressed a world of grief.
0	With silent steps, still sobbing, they left the room.
0	Strange men came in and placed the lid of the coffin over the dead, and drove the nails firmly in; while the blows of the hammer resounded through the house, and echoed in the hearts that were bleeding.
7	"Whither art thou leading me?" asked the guardian angel.
0	A hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl, glowing with all the colors of the rainbow.
8	At times the snow would be piled so high around our hut as almost to hide it, and then my mother appeared most cheerful.
8	She would hold my head between her hands, and sing the songs she never sang at other times, for the Turks, our masters, would not allow it.
2	And the stag answered, 'The Turk has come to our city; he has wild dogs for the chase, a goodly pack.' 'I will drive them away across the islands!' cried the young roebuck; 'I will drive them away across the islands into the deep sea.'
0	And when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist; and on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and watched the black bread baking in the ashes.
5	Then I would clench my fist, and cry, "We will kill these Turks!"
1	Soon after, we heard the sound of firing.
0	I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell asleep.
1	When I awoke, I found myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the hut.
8	The music sounded, and the people left the church hand-in-hand, with joy and gladness.
1	They were the same stars, and in the same position over me as when I used to sit in front of our hut at Delphi, and I had almost begun to fancy I was still there, when suddenly there was a splash in the water- Anastasia had fallen in; but in a moment Aphtanides has sprung in after her, and was now holding her up to me.
7	We dried her clothes as well as we were able, and remained on the water till they were dry; for we did not wish it to be known what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little adopted sister had incurred, in whose life Aphtanides had now a part.
8	How peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wild thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves.
7	My mother lighted a fire, and roasted some roots she had brought with her, and I and my little sister slept among the bushes, without fear of the ugly smidraki, from whose throat issues fire, or of the wolf and the jackal; for my mother sat by us, and I considered her presence sufficient protection.
8	He said he had been longing to see us so much; and he remained with us two whole happy days.
1	"How much you know!"
1	I exclaimed, "and what wonders you can relate?"
8	"I think what you once told me, the finest of all," he replied; "you told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughts- of the good old custom of 'the bond of friendship,'- a custom I should like to follow.
8	Brother, let you and I go to church, as your father and Anastasia's father once did.
8	Your sister Anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and she shall consecrate the deed.
8	Anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed Aphtanides.
8	Then she joined out hands and kissed us on the forehead, and we again prayed silently.
7	I saw it, I understood the cause, and I believe my hand trembled too.
0	"And she shall be thine," he exclaimed; "thine!
0	I also love her, but tomorrow I depart.
0	She looked at Aphtanides with a sweet but mournful expression on her face.
0	"To-morrow you are going to leave us," she said.
0	"I am very sorry."
0	"Sorry!" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.
8	I threw my arms round her, and pressed my lips to hers.
0	Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits.
7	If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage.
7	But often, when he had got half way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were not properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down again.
0	And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head.
0	But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.
0	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.
0	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
0	The pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.
0	How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl.
8	Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
8	"They are Molly and me," said the boy.
8	"How wonderful they are, and so beautiful!"
0	And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.
8	"I may kiss him," she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it.
0	And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
8	Molly had told him that she loved him- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar.
0	One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters.
8	One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
8	"Through the forest, and in the vale, Sweetly warbles the nightingale.
8	He was received with a hearty welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company, where overflowing winecups were passed about.
0	Anthony also said, "Farewell."
0	Not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer Molly's friend.
5	Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
0	"What matters it?" said he; "I am ruined also.
5	I will destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady Venus, the heathen woman.
5	I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."
0	Dark days, heavy trials, with poverty at the door, came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the sea.
0	Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
1	How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthony now, to what he had thought in his childhood!
8	At times he would think in this way; yet again and again the songs would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious.
8	"God's will is the best," he would then say.
8	All has happened for the best.
2	She could not help it, and yet I have been so bitter, and in such enmity against her."
0	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
8	"That flourishes still," said he, as he gazed.
2	"The blossoms are often plucked," said Anthony; "the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty.
2	Forsaken and forgotten, in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public road.
2	There it stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken.
0	It certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over."
0	"Marry! ha, ha!" and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought.
0	There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.
8	A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.
8	The recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony.
7	He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket, whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, "Roses, which I have plucked from the garden."
1	Then he tore away the cloth which covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise of the pious woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her basket- the wine, the bread- had all been changed into roses.
8	In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind of Anthony.
8	He saw the branches of an apple-tree spreading above him.
8	The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.
8	Glorious! wonderful!
8	That apple-tree, planted in love, now appears before me in heavenly beauty."
1	"Hallo! how the nightcap burns!" he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead.
8	The great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived.
1	"That must be wonderful cloth," thought the emperor.
8	"If I were to be dressed in a suit made of this cloth I should be able to find out which men in my empire were unfit for their places, and I could distinguish the clever from the stupid.
8	I must have this cloth woven for me without delay."
8	"I should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth," thought the emperor.
7	But he felt rather uneasy when he remembered that he who was not fit for his office could not see it.
7	Personally, he was of opinion that he had nothing to fear, yet he thought it advisable to send somebody else first to see how matters stood.
7	Everybody in the town knew what a remarkable quality the stuff possessed, and all were anxious to see how bad or stupid their neighbours were.
1	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.
1	The poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen.
7	"Oh dear," he thought, "can I be so stupid?
7	I should never have thought so, and nobody must know it!
7	Is it possible that I am not fit for my office?
7	No, no, I cannot say that I was unable to see the cloth."
8	"Oh, it is very pretty, exceedingly beautiful," replied the old minister looking through his glasses.
8	"What a beautiful pattern, what brilliant colours!
8	I shall tell the emperor that I like the cloth very much."
8	"We are pleased to hear that," said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.
8	"Is it not a beautiful piece of cloth?" asked the two swindlers, showing and explaining the magnificent pattern, which, however, did not exist.
2	"I am not stupid," said the man.
0	"It is therefore my good appointment for which I am not fit.
8	It is very strange, but I must not let any one know it;" and he praised the cloth, which he did not see, and expressed his joy at the beautiful colours and the fine pattern.
8	"It is very excellent," he said to the emperor.
8	"Is it not magnificent?" said the two old statesmen who had been there before.
1	"What is this?" thought the emperor, "I do not see anything at all.
8	"Really," he said, turning to the weavers, "your cloth has our most gracious approval;" and nodding contentedly he looked at the empty loom, for he did not like to say that he saw nothing.
8	"It is magnificent, beautiful, excellent," one heard them say; everybody seemed to be delighted, and the emperor appointed the two swindlers "Imperial Court weavers."
8	The emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: "These are the trousers!"
8	"This is the coat!" and "Here is the cloak!" and so on.
8	"They are all as light as a cobweb, and one must feel as if one had nothing at all upon the body; but that is just the beauty of them."
8	"Indeed!" said all the courtiers; but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to be seen.
8	"How well they look!
8	How well they fit!" said all.
8	"What a beautiful pattern!
8	What fine colours!
8	That is a magnificent suit of clothes!"
8	"Does not my suit fit me marvellously?"
7	The chamberlains, who were to carry the train, stretched their hands to the ground as if they lifted up a train, and pretended to hold something in their hands; they did not like people to know that they could not see anything.
1	The emperor marched in the procession under the beautiful canopy, and all who saw him in the street and out of the windows exclaimed: "Indeed, the emperor's new suit is incomparable!
8	What a long train he has!
8	How well it fits him!"
2	"But he has nothing on at all," said a little child at last.
0	Waldemar Daa remained for a time silent and thoughtful.
0	His daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes, but Lady Daa had driven away, and I drove away too," said the Wind.
0	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
2	"'Leave it alone,' I sang down the chimney; 'leave it alone, it will all end in smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you will burn your fingers.'
2	But Waldemar Daa did not leave it alone, and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me.
8	The master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and mixing.
0	I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.
1	'Look at the alchymic glass,' he cried; 'something glows in the crucible, pure and heavy.'
1	He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, 'Gold! gold!'
8	He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down," said the Wind; "but I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied him through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering.
8	'Found! found!
8	Gold! gold!' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it might flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic glass fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces.
0	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
0	"'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes.
0	'O-h, o-h,' she would say, 'no bell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar Daa.
0	I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!
0	Kind Heaven, grant me that I may die.'
0	Her eyes were glazing, and her heart breaking; but so it would have been, even had the sun not shone that morning on Anna Dorothea.
1	All passed away, passed away!
8	The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the confirmed children sang too, holding each other by the hand, for they had no position yet, and they were all equal in the eyes of God.
1	When the others arrived at the willow trees, where the confectioner had put up his stall, they said: "Now we are out here; the bell does not in reality exist- it is only something that people imagine!"
8	"We must try to find out if it is!"
8	Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea.
8	"I will and must find the bell," he said, "if I have to go to the end of the world."
8	"Oh, what a splendour!"
8	The sea, the great majestic sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and there where sea and heaven met- all melted together in the most glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too.
8	The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.
8	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.
8	He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.
8	Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game.
8	And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings.
7	He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message.
8	"I crack for everybody," said the cracker.
8	"Yes, and a fine noise you make," thought the audience, as the play went on.
8	The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.
8	They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play.
1	Certainly sooner than he expected- for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces.
0	She plucks the withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered rampart, on which many children are playing.
0	What is the old maid thinking of?
8	"The poor little children, how happy they are- how merrily they play and romp together!
0	What red cheeks and what angels' eyes! but they have no shoes nor stockings.
7	They dance on the green rampart, just on the place where, according to the old story, the ground always sank in, and where a sportive, frolicsome child had been lured by means of flowers, toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it, and which was afterwards closed over the child; and from that moment, the old story says, the ground gave way no longer, the mound remained firm and fast, and was quickly covered with the green turf.
8	The little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale, else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth, and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe.
0	Nor do they know anything of the Danish King who here, in the face of the coming foe, took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital, and die here in his nest; they know nothing of the men who have fought here, or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy, clad in white, and 'biding in the snow to surprise the city.
0	"No! the poor little ones are playing with light, childish spirits.
0	Play on, play on, thou little maiden!
7	Soon the years will come- yes, those glorious years.
0	The priestly hands have been laid on the candidates for confirmation; hand in hand they walk on the green rampart.
0	Thou hast a white frock on; it has cost thy mother much labor, and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger dress!
5	You will also wear a red shawl; and what if it hang too far down?
0	People will only see how large, how very large it is.
8	You are thinking of your dress, and of the Giver of all good- so glorious is it to wander on the green rampart!
8	"And the years roll by; they have no lack of dark days, but you have your cheerful young spirit, and you have gained a friend- you know not how.
1	You met, oh, how often!
8	You walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring, on the high days and holidays, when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts, and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring.
0	Alas!
0	It is not so with the human heart!
0	Dark mists, more in number than those that cover the northern skies, cloud the human heart.
0	Poor child! thy friend's bridal chamber is a black coffin, and thou becomest an old maid.
0	From the almshouse window, behind the balsams, thou shalt look on the merry children at play, and shalt see thine own history renewed."
0	And that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds.
5	But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.
5	He said that all men were wicked, and God would punish them for their sins, and that the wicked, when they died, would be cast into hell, to burn for ever and ever.
5	He spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.
7	It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.
8	Meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the sun was shining so beautifully warm, it seemed as though every little flower said: "God, Thy kindness towards us all is without limits."
0	The same evening, upon going to bed, the pastor noticed his wife sitting there quiet and pensive.
7	Alas! eternally- how long!
1	No, I am unable to imagine that, although you say so."
0	She was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for its sun had set for ever.
0	She fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression, just as if she wished to say something to him.
1	The pastor raised himself in bed and stretched his arms towards her, saying, "Not even you can find eternal rest!
1	You suffer, you best and most pious woman?"
1	"And can I not obtain rest in the grave for you?"
1	"Yes, therein, as I believed, as I knew it," said the pastor, "are living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire."
1	"He is but a poor fool, and not doomed to be tortured eternally by fire!"
1	"Only a fool!"
1	"He is ill!
1	That is madness- a joyless madness- besieged by fear and dreadful dreams!"
5	Like a ferocious animal, one of them rose out of his sleep and uttered a horrible cry, and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs with his pointed elbow, and this one turned round in his sleep: "Be quiet, monster- sleep!
5	This happens every night!"
5	"Every night!" repeated the other.
5	"Yes, every night he comes and tortures me!
0	I myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, and the yard dog, of which I had not thought; one could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling I still hear when I wish to sleep; and when I have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me.
5	You can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and I hardly a quarter of an hour!"
5	And the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the face.
7	The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.
7	"Father of all mercy, grant Thou to her the peace that I was unable to procure for her!"
8	"I have it now!" said the dead woman.
0	"WHENEVER a good child dies, an angel of God comes down from heaven, takes the dead child in his arms, spreads out his great white wings, and flies with him over all the places which the child had loved during his life.
8	Then he gathers a large handful of flowers, which he carries up to the Almighty, that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth.
8	And the Almighty presses the flowers to His heart, but He kisses the flower that pleases Him best, and it receives a voice, and is able to join the song of the chorus of bliss."
8	Then they passed over well-known spots, where the little one had often played, and through beautiful gardens full of lovely flowers.
8	"Which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted there?" asked the angel.
0	Close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some wicked hand had broken the stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung faded and withered on the trailing branches.
0	"Poor rose-bush!" said the child, "let us take it with us to heaven, that it may bloom above in God's garden."
8	The angel took up the rose-bush; then he kissed the child, and the little one half opened his eyes.
8	The angel gathered also some beautiful flowers, as well as a few humble buttercups and heart's-ease.
8	"Now we have flowers enough," said the child; but the angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven.
7	It was night, and quite still in the great town.
0	Amidst all this confusion, the angel pointed to the pieces of a broken flower-pot, and to a lump of earth which had fallen out of it.
0	The earth had been kept from falling to pieces by the roots of a withered field-flower, which had been thrown amongst the rubbish.
8	"We will take this with us," said the angel, "I will tell you why as we fly along."
0	"Down in that narrow lane, in a low cellar, lived a poor sick boy; he had been afflicted from his childhood, and even in his best days he could just manage to walk up and down the room on crutches once or twice, but no more.
0	In this spot the poor sick boy would sit warming himself in the sunshine, and watching the red blood through his delicate fingers as he held them before his face.
1	Then he would say he had been out, yet he knew nothing of the green forest in its spring verdure, till a neighbor's son brought him a green bough from a beech-tree.
8	This he would place over his head, and fancy that he was in the beech-wood while the sun shone, and the birds carolled gayly.
1	One spring day the neighbor's boy brought him some field-flowers, and among them was one to which the root still adhered.
8	This he carefully planted in a flower-pot, and placed in a window-seat near his bed.
8	And the flower had been planted by a fortunate hand, for it grew, put forth fresh shoots, and blossomed every year.
8	It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.
8	He watered it, and cherished it, and took care it should have the benefit of every sunbeam that found its way into the cellar, from the earliest morning ray to the evening sunset.
8	The flower entwined itself even in his dreams- for him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume.
8	And it gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord called him.
0	He has been one year with God.
0	During that time the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of the lodgers' removal.
8	And this poor flower, withered and faded as it is, we have added to our nosegay, because it gave more real joy than the most beautiful flower in the garden of a queen."
1	"But how do you know all this?" asked the child whom the angel was carrying to heaven.
8	"I know it," said the angel, "because I myself was the poor sick boy who walked upon crutches, and I know my own flower well."
8	Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.
8	And God pressed the dead child to His heart, and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel, hand in hand.
8	Then the Almighty pressed all the flowers to His heart; but He kissed the withered field-flower, and it received a voice.
8	Then it joined in the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and others in a distant circle, but all equally happy.
8	They all joined in the chorus of praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.
0	Well, perhaps, if in the beginning of a book these were written and printed, many, when they read it, would lay the book down and say, "It seems to me a very miserable title, I don't like things of this sort."
8	So I have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also I take in the Intelligencer, just as he used to do.
8	I am not very young, I have neither wife nor children, nor a library, but, as I said, I read the Intelligencer, which is enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father.
1	And then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and what innocent verses!
8	The newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting objects to me.
0	Here, behind the white iron railings, once a rose-tree grew; it is gone now, but a little bit of evergreen, from a neighboring grave, stretches out its green tendrils, and makes some appearance; there rests a very unhappy man, and yet while he lived he might be said to occupy a very good position.
5	He had enough to live upon, and something to spare; but owing to his refined tastes the least thing in the world annoyed him.
5	If he went to a theatre of an evening, instead of enjoying himself he would be quite annoyed if the machinist had put too strong a light into one side of the moon, or if the representations of the sky hung over the scenes when they ought to have hung behind them; or if a palm-tree was introduced into a scene representing the Zoological Gardens of Berlin, or a cactus in a view of Tyrol, or a beech-tree in the north of Norway.
1	As if these things were of any consequence!
1	Why did he not leave them alone?
1	Who would trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.
8	It is beautiful to observe how wisely nature orders these things.
1	Here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!- but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having a good idea.
8	At last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea.
1	I come here often, and if any of my friends, or those who are not my friends, are too much for me, I go out and choose a plot of ground in which to bury him or her.
1	Then I bury them, as it were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better characters.
1	Then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about it.
8	Let them bury the offenders out of sight, and keep their good temper.
8	"The man with a cheerful temper."
0	Grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to lead a solitary life, and to have nobody with whom he can converse save the great old church Bell.
8	"Ding-dong! ding-dong!" sounded the Bell, when the tower still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam.
8	"Ding-dong! ding-dong!
8	Now I'll retire to rest!" sang the Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and that is why the place is called the "bell-deep."
0	But the Bell got neither rest nor sleep.
8	Down in the Au-mann's haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true, for the Bell is only talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer alone.
8	Ding-dong! ding-dong!"
0	I may sing of everything that is kept concealed behind lock and bars.
0	Yonder it is cold and wet.
7	The rats are eating her up alive!
0	Nobody knows of it!
0	Nobody hears of it!
0	Not even now, for the bell is ringing and singing its loud Ding-dong, ding-dong!'
7	He sought shelter in the church, and shut gate and door behind him.
0	The throng in front of the church knew where they could hit the King, and one of them flung a stone through a pane of glass, and the King lay there dead!
8	"The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees the birds around it, and understands their language.
8	The wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into the world, 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'
0	"But it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not able any longer to ring it out.
0	I became so tired, so heavy, that the beam broke, and I flew out into the gleaming Au, where the water is deepest, and where the Au-mann lives, solitary and alone; and year by year I tell him what I have heard and what I know.
0	But the schoolmaster says that there was not any bell that rung down there, for that it could not do so; and that no Au-mann dwelt yonder, for there was no Au-mann at all!
7	"Be cautious, cautious, and take good heed to thyself," they both say.
8	It is around us, it is in us, it talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them than does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where the Au-mann dwells.
0	The elder one, who was named Care, looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to perform her own business in person; for then she knows it is properly done.
8	"I must tell you," said she, "that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of it I have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes, to introduce amongst mankind.
1	"What odd figures!" thought he; "they must be returning from some masquerade."
1	The astonished counsellor asked what it all meant, and who the gentleman might be.
1	"Good gracious!" he exclaimed; "what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?"
1	Then he shook his head and said, "It cannot possibly be the bishop himself."
5	"It is shameful that the lamps are not lighted here, and it is as muddy as if one were walking in a marsh."
5	"I don't understand your outlandish talk," he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.
1	"Dear me, what have they been erecting here?" he cried, as he caught sight of the East gate, which in olden times used to stand at the end of East Street.
1	"Either I behold a fata morgana, or I must be tipsy," groaned the counsellor.
1	What is the matter with me?"
5	But I cannot bear even that, and it was very foolish to give us punch and hot salmon; I shall speak about it to our hostess, the agent's lady.
7	"This is really frightful; I cannot even recognize East Street.
1	Not a shop to be seen; nothing but old, wretched, tumble-down houses, just as if I were at Roeskilde or Ringstedt.
7	Oh, I really must be ill!
1	Oh dear!
1	I certainly am very queer."
1	"Is that to-day's number of the Day?" he asked, quite mechanically, as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper.
8	"That is very old," said the counsellor, becoming quite cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing.
8	"Where did you get this singular sheet?
8	"Modestia is a beautiful virtue," said the man.
8	"Oh yes," replied the counsellor; "I am very fond of reading useful old books, and modern ones as well, with the exception of every-day stories, of which we really have more than enough.
1	"Every-day stories?" asked the bachelor.
8	"Oh," replied the man, with a smile; "and yet they are very witty, and are much read at Court.
1	"Goodness me! where am I?" said he.
1	It bewildered him as he thought of it.
7	The counsellor felt a cold shiver run all over him.
1	"What is this? what does it mean?" said he; but he was obliged to drink with them, for they overpowered the good man with their politeness.
1	"One might believe that the country was going back to heathenism," he observed.
8	"Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!
8	He thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times, which, with all their errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.
0	The riches and the honor came for me; Yet still my greatest wealth was poverty: Ah, help and pity me!
0	Thou knowest: ah, pity me!
0	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.
0	"The poor watchman in the street," said he, "is far happier than I am.
0	Oh, how much happier I should be could I change my being and position with him, and pass through life with his humble expectations and hopes!
0	Yes, he is indeed happier than I am."
7	All his comrades were very much frightened, for he seemed quite dead; still they allowed him to remain after they had given notice of what had happened; and at dawn the body was carried to the hospital.
7	He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.
5	His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero.
8	"What a free, happy man you are.
8	This is a splendid spring day for a poet, the air is so remarkably clear, the clouds are so beautiful, and the green grass has such a sweet smell.
8	For many years I have not felt as I do at this moment."
8	"What a delightful perfume," said he; "it reminds me of the violets at Aunt Lora's.
0	Yes, this is my fate," and he sighed deeply.
8	It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful."
8	As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, "I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.
0	"Ah!" he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, "they are much better off than I. Flying is a glorious power.
8	He felt what was taking place, and laughed to himself.
8	"Well," thought he, "this is charming; by day I sit in a police-office, amongst the dryest law papers, and at night I can dream that I am a lark, flying about in the gardens of Fredericksburg.
0	It is a miserable story indeed, especially now I have fallen into the hands of boys.
5	The boys carried him into a very elegant room, where a stout, pleasant-looking lady received them, but she was not at all gratified to find that they had brought a lark- a common field-bird as she called it.
8	"It will please Polly perhaps," she said, laughing at a large gray parrot, who was swinging himself proudly on a ring in a handsome brass cage.
8	Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Polly, and repeated his witty saying, "Now let us be men."
7	The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, "Let us be men;" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.
8	"Oh, to travel, to travel!" cried he; "there is no greater happiness in the world: it is the height of my ambition.
0	"Ah," he sighed, "if I were only on the other side of the Alps now, it would be summer, and I should be able to get money on my letter of credit.
0	Oh, I wish I was on the other side of the Alps."
0	It was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to find one they knew not.
0	All the eyes were too eagerly seeking for this resting-place, to notice the beauties of nature.
8	THERE was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers.
8	The butterfly came also to Marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by kindness.
5	But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.
8	"They are very pretty," thought the butterfly; "charming little lasses; but they are rather formal."
0	The violet, a little too sentimental.
8	The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.
8	You know, this plant has no blossom; but it is sweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf.
8	"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.
8	He could exist here, he said, well enough.
0	"But it is not enough merely to exist," said he, "I need freedom, sunshine, and a little flower for a companion."
8	Then he flew against the window-pane, and was seen and admired by those in the room, who caught him, and stuck him on a pin, in a box of curiosities.
0	"It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast."
0	"That seems very poor consolation," said one of the plants in the room, that grew in a pot.
8	"Look at me," said the top to the ball.
8	No one could be happier than we should be."
8	Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his head out of the nest, and says, 'Will you?' and I have said, 'Yes,' to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I will promise never to forget you."
5	"Much good that will be to me," said the top; and they spoke to each other no more.
0	The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone.
0	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
0	The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball.
8	"Now I am in a nice place," said he; "my gilding will soon be washed off here.
0	The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.
0	The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.
0	She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, "God does not know it.
0	Thus in her great grief she fell away from her faith in God, and dark thoughts arose in her mind respecting death and a future state.
0	But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.
0	In her darkest hours she ceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her.
0	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.
0	When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, "We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."
0	"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.
0	She gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder.
0	With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?
0	As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.
0	"Down to my child," she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words.
8	"My sweet, darling mother," she heard the child say.
8	It was the well-known, beloved voice; and kiss followed kiss, in boundless delight.
8	"There is nothing so beautiful on earth as it is here.
8	Oh, it is happiness indeed."
8	"I can fly now, mother," said the child; "I can fly with other happy children into the presence of the Almighty.
0	"Oh, stay, stay!" implored the mother; "only one moment more; only once more, that I may look upon thee, and kiss thee, and press thee to my heart."
7	And then she remembered those she left behind, and a great terror came over her.
0	No; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead.
8	And when she had offered this prayer, her heart felt lighter.
8	Everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened.
8	She bent over her husband, who still slept; her warm, devoted kiss awakened him, and words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both.
8	Now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith: "Whatever He doeth is right and best."
8	And as she kissed him and her children, she said, "It came from God, through my child in the grave."
8	"I obtained the first prize," said the hare.
8	"I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away."
5	"I deserved the first prize, and not the second," said the snail.
5	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."
5	"Boys," said the old man, "a hole goes in, and a hill stands out; have you no eyes in your heads?"
5	"Take care," said the old man, "or people will think you have not been well brought up."
5	"Feet off the table-cloth!" said the old goblin.
0	"No one cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to do to sew my grave clothes."
5	"What tricks have you been playing?" said the old goblin.
0	Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, "Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."
7	She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.
7	"Mercy!" cried Karen.
7	"Don't cut off my head!" said Karen, "for then I could not repent of my sin.
7	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
0	During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.
7	Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.
0	On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.
0	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"
0	The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.
0	I still remember his face, but from whence he came, or whither he went, I know not; no one knows.
5	"Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!" cried the Bishop of Borglum.
5	"Now will I lay the hand of the Pope upon thee, to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee!"
7	They fear an attack from the armed followers of the robber-knights.
0	Then one of them mentioned Thyland in Denmark, and spoke of her sorrows, of her woes, which were soon to cease, for so Divine Providence had willed it.
5	"Thou Borglum bishop," he exclaims, "I shall subdue thee after all!
5	Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!"
5	"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you."
0	Not long after, the king of the country suffered from the deepest melancholy.
0	They read deep and learned books to him, and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no purpose.
7	Then said the swineherd, "I am afraid I carried this plant away from the forest in my bundle, and it has been burnt to ashes long ago.
7	But I did not know any better."
5	Ignorance upon ignorance indeed!"
0	The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant.
0	Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in the wood.
0	For the plant had disappeared, and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever, but the sentry said he had always been so.
7	And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him.
0	In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, roamed through the streets.
0	No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given here even a penny.
0	Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.
0	In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together.
7	She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money.
7	Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags.
0	Then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall before her.
0	"Some one is dying," thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to God.
0	"Grandmother," cried the little one, "O take me with you; I know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious Christmas-tree."
5	But the tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were vexed.
0	The peonies were sulky; it was well that they could not speak, otherwise they would have given the daisy a good lecture.
0	The little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease, and pitied them sincerely.
0	Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
0	The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
7	"Pluck the flower off" said the other boy, and the daisy trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and it wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf into the poor captive lark's cage.
0	The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
0	"I have no water," said the captive lark, "they have all gone out, and forgotten to give me anything to drink.
0	My throat is dry and burning.
0	I feel as if I had fire and ice within me, and the air is so oppressive.
0	I must die, and part with the warm sunshine, the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that God has created."
0	Then it noticed the little daisy, and nodded to it, and kissed it with its beak and said: "You must also fade in here, poor little flower.
0	Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
0	The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
0	The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
0	The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.
0	While it was alive and sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now, they cried over it and covered it with flowers.
7	I cannot sleep alone to-night.
5	"Prenez garde aux enfants!" said father owl; "children should not hear such things."
7	"Wake up! wake up!" crowed the cock, and flew upon his board.
7	Sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: "Three hens have died of their unfortunate love for a cock.
0	The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.
0	He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.
0	And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully, and said, "Forgotten!
0	Ah, yes, everything will be forgotten!"
0	But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.
7	When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.
7	He did so, for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton.
7	The woman then quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for.
7	The woman dared not say anything; so she placed the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and the pastry.
7	"Do you hear? he answers 'Yes,' but he fears that we shall not like to look at him."
7	"Will you come and help me hold it?" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.
7	"No, leave it alone," cried the sexton from within the chest; "let me out first."
7	"Oh," exclaimed Little Claus, pretending to be frightened, "he is in there still, is he?
7	"Oh, no; oh, no," cried the sexton; "I will give you a whole bushel full of money if you will let me go.
5	"He is making fools of us," said they all; then the shoemakers took their straps, and the tanners their leather aprons, and began to beat Great Claus.
5	"Skins, skins!" they cried, mocking him; "yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue."
5	"Out of the town with him," said they.
7	And Great Claus was obliged to run as fast as he could, he had never before been so thoroughly beaten.
5	"Ah," said he, as he came to his house; "Little Claus shall pay me for this; I will beat him to death."
5	"There," cried he, "now you cannot make a fool of me again;" and then he went home.
5	The landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff.
5	Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.
7	Dear Little Claus, I will give you a bushel of money; I will bury your grandmother as if she were my own; only keep silent, or else they will cut off my head, and that would be disagreeable."
7	Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.
7	The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let him drive where he liked.
5	"You shall pay for this," said Great Claus, as soon as he got into the highroad, "that you shall, Little Claus."
5	"You have played me another trick," said he.
5	"First, I killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more."
5	So he laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, "Now I'm going to drown you in the river.
7	"Oh dear, oh dear," sighed Little Claus in the sack, as he turned and twisted about; but he found he could not loosen the string with which it was tied.
7	I was frightened, to be sure, while I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me.
5	"Tin soldier," said the goblin, "don't wish for what does not belong to you.
7	The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.
7	"Where am I going now?" thought he.
7	The poor little elf was very much frightened.
7	The hat was on the head now, which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with fright and indignation at the wicked deed.
5	But her wicked brother scolded her, and asked her if she was going mad.
5	He could not imagine why she was weeping over that flower-pot, and it annoyed him.
5	"That is nothing to you," replied the witch; "you have the money, now give me the tinder-box."
5	"I tell you what," said the soldier, "if you don't tell me what you are going to do with it, I will draw my sword and cut off your head."
5	"No," said the witch.
7	In the morning he could see through the iron grating of the little window how the people were hastening out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, and saw the soldiers marching.
7	"Help me now, that I may not be hanged," cried the soldier.
7	The country people say that this appearance is caused by lightning; but I will tell you what the sparrow says, and the sparrow heard it from an old willow-tree which grew near a field of buckwheat, and is there still.
5	But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, "Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."
7	There arose a very terrible storm.
7	All the field-flowers folded their leaves together, or bowed their little heads, while the storm passed over them, but the buckwheat stood erect in its pride.
7	"Bend your head as we do," said the flowers.
5	"I have no occasion to do so," replied the buckwheat.
7	"Bend your head as we do," cried the ears of corn; "the angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath.
7	He will strike you down before you can cry for mercy."
5	"But I will not bend my head," said the buckwheat.
7	"Close your flowers and bend your leaves," said the old willow-tree.
7	"Do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts; even men cannot do that.
7	In a flash of lightning heaven opens, and we can look in; but the sight will strike even human beings blind.
7	What then must happen to us, who only grow out of the earth, and are so inferior to them, if we venture to do so?"
5	"Inferior, indeed!" said the buckwheat.
5	"Now I intend to have a peep into heaven."
5	"Well," quoth Jack the Dullard, "If I can't have a horse, I'll take the Billy-goat, who belongs to me, and he can carry me very well!"
7	All the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to see the Princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the hall, his power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a candle that is blown out.
7	In the autumn, as usual, the wood-cutters came and cut down several of the tallest trees, and the young fir-tree, which was now grown to its full height, shuddered as the noble trees fell to the earth with a crash.
5	"It would take too much time to explain," said the stork, flying quickly away.
7	"And then," asked the fir-tree, trembling through all its branches, "and then what happens?"
7	How the fir-tree trembled!
7	"What was going to happen to him now?"
7	After this, the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire frightened him; he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him.
7	Whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked, he was in a great fright, for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees.
5	"'I certainly am vexed,' said the basket; 'inwardly vexed, more than any one can imagine.
7	But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know how to answer such a question.
5	"Get away; don't come so near me," said the garter, "you appear to me quite like a man."
5	"What! is he going to propose to me?" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.
5	"Not all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too.
7	In the night there was a terrible storm.
7	The hens, chicks, and even the cock sought shelter; the wind tore down the planks between the two yards with a crash; the tiles came tumbling down, but the weather-cock sat firm.
5	He had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the air- the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers.
5	He admitted that the pigeons, large and white and shining like mother-o'-pearl, looked like a kind of weather-cock; but they were fat and stupid, and all their thoughts and endeavours were directed to filling themselves with food, and besides, they were tiresome things to converse with.
5	All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.
5	"The world is no good!" he said.
5	"Everything in it is so stupid."
5	The weather-cock was puffed up, and that quality would have made him interesting in the eyes of the cucumber if it had known it, but it had eyes only for the yard cock, who was now in the yard with it.
5	"What do you think of that crowing?" said the yard cock to the hens and chickens.
5	"Everything is very stupid," the weather-cock said to himself.
5	"The yard cock lays no eggs, and I am too lazy to do so; if I liked, I could lay a wind-egg.
5	But the world is not worth even a wind-egg.
5	Everything is so stupid!
5	I don't want to sit here any longer."
5	But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.
7	No one could tell, for terror had seized upon all.
5	"Did I not say so?" said the darning-needle, "I know I am too fine for such work as that."
7	"Now I am going on a journey," said the needle, as she floated away with the dirty water, "I do hope I shall not be lost."
7	"White walls, and I am black myself," said the darning-needle, "that looks well; now I can be seen, but I hope I shall not be sea-sick, or I shall break again."
7	I am breaking!" but she did not break, though the waggon went over her as she lay at full length; and there let her lie.
7	"Don't speak so loud, or she will wake," said the toad, "and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's down.
5	"Now don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth.
5	"Away, away," barked the old yard-dog.
5	I know nothing of any nightingale.
5	Is there such a bird in my empire? and even in my garden?
5	I will hear the nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highest favor; and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended."
5	Sing! sing!"
5	"Stop! stop!" and the words came quite clear, though they were like the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird.
5	"A grave! dig me a grave!"
5	He nodded, and pointed to Anne Lisbeth, crying out, "Hold fast! hold fast! and then you may ride again in a nobleman's carriage, and forget your child."
5	He's angry to-day.
5	"'Snik, snak, snurre, bassellurre!
5	I'm master of this house!
5	Snikke, snakke, snak!
5	Oh! pray let me out, And like a lamb led to slaughter I'll betroth you, no doubt, To my daughter.'"
5	But the professor did not approve of such nonsense, so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it.
5	Then the leaves, which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never ventured to touch a nettle since."
5	So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.
5	"Why did not somebody tell me?"
5	And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise.
5	But now she had to come out, and they tugged at her, and pulled her about, and ate her up.
5	"Yes; but what do you think it is?" said Kribble-Krabble.
5	"Look out for the drumsticks," replied Peter; and, small as he was, he ran up boldly, and gave the foremost such a punch in the body with his fist, that the fellow lost his legs and tumbled over, and the others took their legs off with themselves very rapidly.
5	"Yes, we have my boy," she retorted.
